<CENTER><H1>Information about Relay and how to use it</H1>
<HR></CENTER>
You are a user at an institution whose mainframe computer(s) is
connected to BITNET, EARN (Bitnet in Europe), or a cooperating
network. As such, you have the ability to send an interactive
message to any other user on those networks. But if you do, that
person is the only person to see that message. Think about what
it would be like if many people, all over the world, could see
your message, and you could see theirs. That's Relay.<p>
Relay is a distributed messaging network, overlaying BITNET/EARN,
composed of many linked Relay host sites. Its purpose is to serve
as an Academic Conferencing System. The users on Relay may be in
many different physical locations, even different countries, but
they all appear to be talking as if they were sitting next to each
other. When on Relay, you'll be sending interactive messages to
RELAY@VTBIT. Other users you meet on Relay will be sending their
interactive messages to other Relay servers, but you can all talk
to each other because RELAY@VTBIT is "linked" to these other servers.<p>
The Virginia Tech Computing Center provides Relay as a service
to the network community. As Virginia Tech is providing the funding,
all users at other universities should be aware that use of this Relay
is a privilege, not a right. The Master Relay Operater (MasterOp) is an
employee of Virginia Tech and enlists other users, either at Virginia
Tech or elsewhere, to serve as Relay Operators (RelayOps) who assist
in the administration and smooth operation of the Relay.<p>
The MasterOp and his RelayOps reserve the right to make the final
decision on appropriate behavior. Many users would claim that the right
of free speech allows them to carry on any activities they wish on this
relay. Free speech is not the primary principle that runs this relay;
low cost is. Any activity that is deemed to be wasting resources of this
university may be terminated. Any users that disagree with the policies
of the Virginia Tech Relay (known as Va_Tech) are welcome to apply to the
Relay Master Coordinator for their own copy of Relay, and to set up a node
that they can fund on their own university's machine. Please note that
decisions made by the Va_Tech operators are subjective, and may or may not
represent official university policies.<p>
Relay works on the idea of channels. You may talk directly to the
users on your channel, or use Relay commands to talk to others and to
perform specific tasks. The "/" is the command prefix for Relay. Any
message beginning with it is interpreted as a command. All other
messages are relayed to every other user on your channel.<p>
<b>Examples:</b><p>
Here's how you'd send a message from you to everyone on the channel:<p>
<dl>
<dd>From VM/CMS Systems: TELL RELAY AT VTBIT Hi there!
<dd>From VAX/VMS Systems: SEND RELAY@VTBIT Hi there!
<dd><i>or</i>
<dd>SEND/NOPROMPT RELAY@VTBIT and then press
<dd>return <enter>,
<dd>and type messages at the prompt.
</dl><p>
Here's how you'd send a command to Relay. As an example, here's the
HELP command. This command will provide a listing of all Relay commands:<p>
<dl>
<dd>From VM/CMS Systems: TELL RELAY AT VTBIT /help
<dd>From VAX/VMS systems: SEND RELAY@VTBIT /help
<dd><i>or</i>
<dd>END/NOPROMPT RELAY@VTBIT and then press
<dd>return <enter>, and type /help at the prompt.
</dl><p>
Please note that you cannot send messages to Relay by E-Mail, Telnet,
FTP, or IRC. Relay is a service that is only accessible to
BITNET/EARN interactive users, and at the present time has no Internet
access.<p>
To use Relay, you must first 'sign on', which adds you to the list of
users currently using Relay (see below for more information on how to
sign on). Ordinarily, when you sign on, you are placed on channel
number 1. You can, at any time, change to another channel (see example
below). Channels are always a number, and the following channel divisions
are supported as of Relay version 2.06b:<p>
Channel 1 is the default, public channel.<p>
Channels 0 through 99 are public channels.<p>
Channels between 100 and 999 are private channels; the channel
number does not appear on the user list (it is shown as '??'),
but anyone has the capability of joining an occupied channel in
that range with the /channel command.<p>
Channels between 1000 and 999999999 are private channels as well;
the channel number does not appear on the user list (it is
shown as '??'), and no user is permitted to join an occupied
channel in that range without being invited by someone on that
channel with the /invite command.<p>
Channels less than zero (negative channels) are 'super-private';
users on a negative channel do not appear on the user list at all.<p>
Channels -1 to -999 can be joined by any user with the /channel
command.<p>
Channels between -1000 to -999999999 are 'super-private' as well;
no user is permitted to join an occupied channel in that range
without being invited by someone on that channel with the /invite
command.<p>
<b>/Signon [nickname] [channel],[options]</b><p>
In order to start using Relay, you must use the /signon command. The
parameter <nickname> is used to give yourself a name which will be used
to prefix all of your messages. If you omit the nickname, Relay will
use your user ID. However, once you've chosen a nickname and used it
in the /signon command, Relay will remember the nickname and auto-
matically assign it to you even if you do not specify a nickname the
next time you issue you the /signon command to join Relay. Then when
you're signed on, Relay will put your nickname in front of everything
you say so people know who's talking.<p>
Example: If the nickname you've chosen is Superman, and you do:<p>
TELL RELAY AT VTBIT Hello, everyone.<p>
Then everyone on your channel sees: <Superman> Hello, everyone.<p>
If you wish to signon to a specific channel, you can give the channel number
following the nickname; if you omit it, you will be placed on channel 1.<p>
For the benefit of users on special terminals, such as Japanese Katakana
terminals with no lowercase characters, you can signon with SHIFT as an
option field (/signon myname,shift). Relay will then translate messages
to uppercase before sending to you.<p>
For users on terminals with uppercase only but who want their messages
to appear to everyone else in lowercase, you can use the 'UNSHIFT' option.
This will translate your messages to lowercase.<p>
Examples: /signon LoisLane 10<br>
/signon Superman 10,unshift<p>
<b>/Signoff (also /Bye)</b><p>
This command is used to leave Relay.<p>
<b>/Who</b><p>
The /who command will list all users on all channels, showing their
channel number (if not private), nickname, real user ID and node name,
and the name of the Relay they are using. To list only users on a single
channel, use '/who <channel>' (e.g. /who 25). To list only users on your
channel use the command '/who *' (you must be signed on to use this form).<p>
<b>/Names</b><p>
The same as the /who command, but /names returns slightly different
information, including the users' /register (real) names.<p>
<b>/Whois <nickname> or /Whois <userid@node></b><p>
The /whois <nickname> command will show you the real user ID and node
of the user with the given nickname. It will also show you the user's
/register name. Often in conversation users will exchange mail or files
with each other, and the /whois command lets you quickly find out their
user ID and node.<p>
Example: /whois LoisLane<p>
If you already know the user's user ID and node, you can use the
/whois command to find out which nickname they are currently using
by using the /whois <userid@node> command.<p>
Example: /whois stu123@statevm<p>
<b>/List</b><p>
The /list command displays the currently active positive channels and
how many users are on each channel. To list only those channels with
defined /topics, the command is: /TList.<p>
<b>/Links</b><p>
The /links command displays all currently active relays and the
configuration in which they are linked to each other.<p>
<b>/Help</b><p>
The /help command will display an abbreviated list of commands for quick
reference, one line per command showing the syntax and meaning of each.<p>
<b>/Info</b><p>
The /info command sends you this file. If your host relay does not send
the file (it may not be on its disk) you can request /info from another
relay.<p>
<b>/Channel <number></b><p>
The /channel command is used to change to another channel.<p>
Example: /channel 25<p>
<b>/Msg <nickname> <message-text></b><p>
The /msg command sends a private message to only the user you specify by
nickname. You can send private messages to anyone signed on regardless
of which channel they're on. Private messages appear with asterisks around
the sending user's nickname.<p>
Example: Superman does: /msg LoisLane Do you know who I am?
LoisLane sees: <*Superman*> Do you know who I am?<p>
<b>/Ignore <nickname></b><p>
The /ignore command allows you to screen out private messages from
someone who may be bothering or harassing you. If you use it, the
user you /ignore will no longer be able to send to you via Relay.<p>
Example: /ignore LexLuthor<p>
<b>/Nick <new-nickname></b><p>
The /Nick command is used to change your nickname, useful for correcting
typing errors or schizophrenic personalities. Note: If you fail to
specify a nickname the next time you /signon, Relay will automatically
assign you the nickname you used on your last /signon, regardless of
whether you later changed it with /nick.<p>
<b>/Summon [userid]@[node]</b><p>
The /Summon command causes an invitation to be sent to the user you've
specified, who is not currently on Relay, asking them to join Relay on
your channel. Note for VM users: the '@' is sometimes a character
delete symbol; in regular CMS you may have to type 'userid"@node' to
really get the '@' character.<p>
Example: /summon stu123@statevm<p>
<b>/Invite <nickname></b><p>
The /invite command causes a private message to be sent to the specified
nickname inviting them to join you on your channel. This is a quick way
to summon a user who is already signed on, but on a different channel.
If you are on a channel below -999 or above 999, the only way another
user will be permitted to join your channel is if you use the /invite
command to allow them entrance.<p>
<b>/Stats</b><p>
The /stats command displays basic statistics concerning your session
on Relay. Specifically, it shows you the Relay you're using and
its version number, your nickname, /register name, channel you're
currently on, and the /topic set on the channel.<p>
Note: The above list of commands is not all-inclusive. The /help
command will return a list of all available commands.<p>
