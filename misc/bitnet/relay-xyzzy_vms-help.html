                              For Version 2.10
<HR> 
Following is a  list of all of  the valid  Xyzzy-Vax commands.  Each command is
shown along with it's syntax,  and a short explanation.  Note that capitals are
used to show the minimum legal abbreviation of a command.
 
In  the descriptions  below,  the following conventions  are used  to show  the
command syntax:
 
     < ... >       Angle Brackets are used to denote optional items.
     X  |  Y       This shows that either X or Y may be chosen.
     ( X           A parenthesis shows that X is an option.
 
   When  "id" is specified as part of the syntax, it refers to one of the
following:
 
       Nickname      - Nickname which is found in your NAMES file
                       or a local nickname in use within Xyzzy-Vax
       User          - User at your local node or a user who is in
                       the Xyzzy-Vax "talking" list
       User@Node     - User at a remote node as specified
       User AT Node  - Same as User@Node except using the word "AT"
       #             - Number of person in the Xyzzy-Vax "talking" list
 
   Any of the above forms may be optionally followed by "!nick" where
   nick is a temporary nickname for use within Xyzzy-Vax, and (Real Name.
 
   For example:  .ADDN USER@NODE!Nick(Real Name
 
   (See the Xyzzy-Vax help section on Names files for more information)
 
   (Note that in the form user@node or user AT node - the construct
    user%endnode@Node can be used. This will indicate the person to be
    user@endnode - with Node being used as an intermediate node for
    routing.  For more information, see the Xyzzy-Vax help section on
    the ROUTE command)

NOTES:
   There  is two exceptions  to the rule  that  a period  must always  be
followed by a standard command: 
 
Firstly it may also be followed by a "id". If  there is  a message on the 
line, it  is then  interpreted as  a SEND to that id, otherwise, it is
considered a SWITCH.  For example: 
 
   (assuming that DAVID is a legal nickname from your names file)
          .DAVID      is equivalent to   .SWITCH DAVID
          .DAVID Hi   is equivalent to   .SEND DAVID Hi
   (or if there exists a user DB3L @ CMUCCVMA in your talking list)
          .DB3L       is equivalent to   .SWITCH DB3L@CMUCCVMA
          .DB3L       is equivalent to   .SEND DB3L@CMUCCVMA Hi
   (and so on...)
 
   Making use of this can make it easier to communicate with people other
than your "current user", and nicer to switch to a new current user.
 
Secondly a . may be followed by a Macro Command that was defined using the
.ADDMacro command. Any parameters following the Macro Command will be passed
on.
 
For eaxmple:
 
.ADDM SHU .DCL SHOW USERS
 
followed by 
 
.SHU ROSK
 
will show if user ROSK is logged on the local node.
 
Macrocommands may contain Expansion sequences. The Macrocommand must be 
defined with Expand set off, and executed with Expand set on.
