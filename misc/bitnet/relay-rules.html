<EM>(User Responsibilities Section excerpted from RELAY INFO file.)
</EM><p>
Relay is a distributed message server which, by selective switching and
redistribution of messages, provides real-time conferencing capabilities
while minimizing the overhead on the network links.  Since the potential
load of uncontrolled message traffic on the network can affect transfer
of files, stringent controls over Relay use are mandatory.  Most control
measures are enforced by Relay automatically, but some are necessarily
the responsibility of the user.  These include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Each Relay server provides service to a specific collection of
     one or more nodes designated as a "service area".  You should
     direct your queries only to your assigned Relay.

<li>
Excessive queries, channel changes, nick changes, and other
     commands which must be processed by Relay generate considerable
     overhead and should be kept to a minimum.

<li>
File backlogs, Relay host CPU saturation, link failures, and node
     downtime may make Relay temporarily unavailable or restricted.

<li>Proper and considerate behavior should be observed at all times.
     The same socially accepted behavior in public in real life also
     applies to your conduct and behavior on Relay.  Behavior on
     public channels (0-99) should follow conservative standards.  Less
     restrictive standards can be followed on private channels (100-999).

   <p>  Some DON'TS in the behavior category include, but are not limited
     to, the following:
<p>
<ul>
     <li>Disguising your identity in a /REGister (or /SIGNUP) by not
        specifying your full name or by specifying someone else's name.
     <li>Transmitting rude or obscene language.
     <li>Using obscene or offensive nicks; using all-symbol nicks.
     <li>Signing-on more than one account on Relay at the same time.
     <li>Channel scanning; attempting to intrude on a private channel
        without obtaining an invitation from a user on that channel.
     <li>Annoying other Relay users by transmitting excessive and/or
        repetitive messages (including pictures).
     <li>Failing to cease an activity in response to a request to do so
        from any individual designated as a 'Relay Operator'.
     <li>Rude and discourteous behavior toward other users.  The same
        manners and courtesies that apply to every day life also
        apply to Relay.
     <li>Using other people's accounts without their permission and
        without the node admin's permission.  Using other people's
        accounts for Relaying without the Masterop's approval.
     <li>Running programs on Relay without prior permission from
        the MasterOp and/or node admin; signed onto Relay disconnected;
        (loads the net and raises cpu unnecessarily).
</ul><p>

<li>Abusive and obscene behavior should be reported to a RelayOp
     who is signed onto Relay at that time by issuing the "/GETOP"
     command.  (This command shouldn't be used for trivial or
     non-Relay matters, however.)  If you get no response from the
     "/GETOP" command, you can send a note about the problem to
     your Master RelayOp.  (Sending the "/CO" command to your Relay
     will give you your Relay's MasterOp's name and userid.)
</ul><p>
Not observing Relay and Bitnet guidelines and protocol can result in
suspension of Relay privileges.  Relay is a *privilege*, NOT a right,
and Relay abuse will NOT be tolerated!
