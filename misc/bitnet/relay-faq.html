   In the early 1980's, Henry Nussbacher released CHAT ANALYSIS, a paper        
   warning that if unrestricted chat machine usage and interactive              
   messaging were allowed to continue in their current state, the load on       
   the network would doom BITNET.  As a result, efforts to decrease             
   network and CPU loads were begun.  In 1985, Jeff Kell, at the                
   University of Tennessee -- Chattanooga, developed RELAY, a distributed       
   messaging program, written in REXX.  Over the ensuing years, RELAY's         
   growth exploded.  In 1989, Valdis Kletnieks, then at Clarkson                
   University, developed RELAY V2, written in Pascal.  Both versions of         
   RELAY were significant improvements over the previous state of the           
   network.

   RELAY is a distributed messaging network, overlaying BITNET/EARN,            
   composed of many linked RELAY host sites.  Its purpose is to serve as        
   an Academic Conferencing System, similar in function to a CB radio           
   network.  The users may be in many different physical locations, even        
   from different countries.  All appear to be talking as if they were          
   sitting next to each other.

   RELAY works on the idea of channels.  You may talk directly to the           
   users in your channel, or use RELAY commands to talk to others and to        
   perform specific tasks.  The "/" is the command prefix for RELAY.  Any       
   message beginning with it is interpreted as a command.  All other            
   messages are relayed to every other user in your channel.

   Please note that you cannot send messages to RELAY by E-Mail, Telnet,

   BITNET/EARN interactive users, and at the present time has no Internet       
   access.

<A NAME="Q4"><b>Why do I have to use my real name in my /REGISTER?</b></a>                           
<p>
   RELAY exists in a state of almost constant self-justification.  There        
   have been several instances when certain individuals have abused RELAY       
   to the  point of losing the privilege of sending interactive messages        
   on BITNET.  It is a much easier task to point a finger at individuals        
   who are likely troublemakers, as well as help assign some name               
   recognition to each account if RELAY requires individuals to use their       
   real name in a /REGISTER.  In addition, since some universities allow        
   the use of one account by more than one person, forcing each user to         
   /REGISTER with a different name lets operators easily identify the           
   individual who may be having problems, versus the users who are              
   skilled RELAY veterans.  It also makes it easier to avoid confusion,         
   as many people share nicknames with other users.  Having the /REGISTER       
   information there allows a user to know which is the person with whom        
   conversations have been held, and which is the unknown person.               
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             
                                                                                
<A NAME="Q5"><b>Why can't I use whatever RELAY server I want?</b></a>                               
<p>
    One of RELAY's major goals is keep network load to a minimum.  To           
    help accomplish this goal, each node on the network is assigned             
    to use the RELAY server most directly linked to it in the network.          
    This is called the node's 'primary' server.  At times when network          
    conditions make the primary server unreachable, a 'secondary'               
    server may be used.  For a full list of your node's primary and             
    secondary servers, send the /SERVERS command to RELAY.  The syntax          
    is:<p>                                                                         
    <PRE>/SERVERS <nodename></PRE><br>
    where nodename is the node you need             
    approximated to the nearest host.               
    <br>Example: <PRE>/SERVERS UTKVX3</PRE><p>                                                        
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>
                                                                                
<A NAME="Q6"><b>Why is there a prime time?</b></a>                                                   
<p>
   Prime time is yet another way of limiting the amount of traffic on           
   RELAY and the network itself.  During the day, the computers of many         
   colleges and universities are severely loaded down by jobs not related       
   to the network in any way.  These machines do stay linked to the             
   network and process many files intended for research projects and            
   correspondence.  Use of RELAY during certain daytime hours is thus           
   restricted so as not to add to the network and CPU loads, and so as to       
   keep the administrators happy.  If you have legitimate conferencing          
   needs during the day, you may apply through the Masterop of your host        
   for the ability to sign on during prime time hours.                          
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                                

<A NAME="Q7"><b>Why is there a limit to the number of people on a channel, 
or a host?</b></a>        
<p>
   Again, network considerations force RELAY to place limits on the             
   number of users. RELAY can only help the network by sending out              
   messages in a fashion that is less time consuming to the network             
   itself.  If many people are signed on RELAY, and all on the same             
   channel, RELAY's helpfulness to the network is severely limited.

<p>
   RELAY provides two basic commands for viewing who is signed on               
   at a given time.  They are the /WHO and /NAMES commands.  The                
   format and information displayed on each user differs between                
   them, but the syntax for each is the same.  The three forms of               
   the commands are as follows:                                                 
   <p>                                                                             
   <PRE>
   /WHO       -  Displays all users signed onto the RELAY network.          
   /WHO *     -  Displays all users on the same channel you occupy.         
   /WHO #     -  Displays all users on channel number #.

   If a user (including yourself) has a "-" next to the name, it means          
   that the user is currently using the same host server as you.

   The number sign indicates that the user is a Master Operator.                
   These individuals have the responsibility of the maintenance and             
   daily operation of the host servers.  They influence the rules that          
   are specific to their server and are involved in handling the more           
   difficult problems.                                                          
   Most RELAY servers disablee the "#" symbols, due to new releases                                                                             
   of RELAY. This means that you will see the "*" symbol for operators
   as well as masteroperators.

   on a private channel.  (further description of private channels below)

<p>
   RELAY has two types of channels.  Public channels, 0 - 99, are listed        
   in numerical order.  You are able to identify which users are in             
   which channels.  Private channels, 100 - 999, are not listed in order.       
   You can not identify which users are in which private channels.              
   Because they are private, it is against RELAY rules and etiquette to         
   change to a private channel unless you are invited to that channel           
   or unless you know that the channel is unoccupied.                           
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q16"><b>How do I make sure the private channel is

<p>
   Send a /NAMES <channel-number> command to RELAY, and it will report          
   the status of a private channel (Occupied/Unoccupied).  Note that            
   using this command on a public channel will display a list of all            
   users on that channel.

<p>
   Send the /CHANNEL <new-channel-number> command.                              
   <br>
   Example: (you want to go to channel 2)<br>                                       
   <PRE>/CHANNEL 2</PRE>

<A NAME="Q18"><b>How can I see what the topics are on the channels?</b></a>                           
<p>
   The /TLIST command will show you a list of each channel which has a          
   topic associated with it.  Note that private channels will show up           
   with a topic, but the channel number field will be a double question         
   mark.

<A NAME="Q19"><b>How can I change the topic in the topic list?</b></a>                                
<p>
   You may change the topic on your channel by using the /TOPIC command.        
   Note, however, that you should first obtain permission from the other        
   users on the channel before you change the topic.  Only one channel          
   topic change is permitted per channel per 5-minute time span.

<A NAME="Q20"><b>Why is there a time limit on when the 
topics can be changed?</b></a>                 
<p>
   In the past, there was no time limit on how frequently topics could be       
   changed.  This could create some situations when people would change         
   the topic back and forth very rapidly, in what we call a 'topic war'.        
   This is detrimental to network load, and thus we have had to limit the       
   number of changes that can occur in time.                                    
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q21"><b>What does the <<nick>> symbol mean?</b></a>                                          
<p>
   To properly explain this symbol, we must first explain the concept of        
   'ghosting'.  RELAY is a network, in some senses, very much like the          
   BITNET itself.  It sends messages around to its individual hosts,            
   informing them of who has signed on and where they are, etc.  No             
   network is perfect.  RELAY, being a an overlay, is less perfect than         
   most.  Occasionally, RELAY will not get the message that a person is         
   signed on, and thus, that person becomes a "ghost".  That person may         
   still be able to talk to the channel (s)he is on, but the nickname           
   will be shown to the users in the format shown above.  If you see            
   someone's nick bracketed by the "<<" and ">>" symbols, wait to make          
   sure that RELAY isn't correcting the problem itself (which it can do),       
   and then inform the user of the problem.                                     
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q22"><b>How do users become ghosted, and how can 
they become unghosted?</b></a>              
<p>
   Users become ghosted in the manner described above. The BEST way to          
   unghost yourself is to signoff your host server then signon again.           
   RELAY contains some internal procedures designed to eliminate ghosts,        
   some of which result in the "*Deghosted User*" sometimes seen in the         
   /NAMES list.  Please note that RELAY operators do not have the power         
   to unghost you.                                                              
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q23"><b>What does it mean when RELAY says not all 
RELAY hosts know what my nick is, or what channel I'm on?  
How do I fix it?</b></a>                           
<p>
   This is a special case of the ghosting problem.  RELAY has detected          
   the fact that you are a ghost, but RELAY is unable to correct the            
   situation.  Once again, signing off at your RELAY host is the best           
   way to deal with this problem.                                               
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             
                                                                                
<A NAME="Q24"><b>Why did RELAY kick me off just then?</b></a>                                        
<p>
   The /BYE or /SIGNOFF commands are the only way that you can actually        
    sign yourself off RELAY. There are, however, quite a few other ways         
    in which you can end up being removed from the system, most of them         
    automatic functions of the RELAY software.  Below is a listing of           
    some of the possibilities:                                                  
    <p>                                                                            
    </ul>
    <li><b>Deletion by Operator:</b>  This one should not come as a surprise to you        
       when it happens.  In most cases, you shall have ample warning from       
       an Operator before he or she actually removes you from RELAY.  If        
       such a measure is finally deemed necessary, you shall see a              
       message saying which Operator deleted you and a short reason for         
       it.                                                                      
                                                                                
    <li><b>Removal for Hyperactivity:</b>  RELAY is intended for normal chatting           
       and occasional use of the various commands.  Sending huge streams        
       of commands, using picture sending programs, or in other ways            
       flooding the system with messages will result in your removal from       
       RELAY with approximately a 15 minute suspension of privileges.           
       RELAY will notify you that you have been removed due to                  
       "hyperactivity."                                                         
                                                                                
    <li><b>Removal for Inactivity:</b>  This is one of RELAY's automatic cleanup           
       routines.  Because of the host limits (discussed above), users who       
       go for extended periods of time without sending a message or             
       command to RELAY are automatically removed.  This helps keep space       
       available for people who wish to actively use the system.  The           
       only message you receive from RELAY in this case is a signoff            
       message.                                                                 
                                                                                
    <li><b>Removal due to Network Problems:</b>  If the physical network links             
       between you and your RELAY host go down, RELAY will automatically        
       sign you off.  You shall most likely receive no notification in          
       this case since RELAY is unable to get messages to you.  You shall       
       be able to sign back on as soon as the network links are restored.       
                                                                                
    <li><b>Removal due to Being Unable to Receive Messages:</b>  This category             
       embraces several different possibilities.  If RELAY tries to send        
       a message to you and your host system responds to RELAY saying           
       that you are no longer signed on, or that you are not currently          
       receiving messages, RELAY will automatically sign you off.  A case       
       where the first could happen would be trying to sign off at one          
       terminal and on at another one, while remaining on RELAY.  One           
       case where the second would happen occurs when you issue the             
       command to disable messages to your BITNET address (e.g. VM/CMS -        
       SET MSG OFF, VAX/VMS - SET BROADCAST=NONE).  A third possibility         
       is one which generally affects only users on VAX/VMS systems.            
       Using the HOLD SCREEN or PAUSE key for too long, especially during       
       a /WHO list or on a busy channel, can result in the message              
       buffers of your system filling up.  When this happens, your system       
       will tell RELAY that you are "not receiving messages temporarily."       
       When RELAY sees this, it will sign you off, just as it did for           
       intentionally going to a non-receiving condition.                        
       </ul>

 None of these topics are directly connected with RELAY.  Further,           
    many of them vary from system to system.  For this reason, RELAY            
    Operators are often unable to help you with questions of this kind.         
    Your local computer center administrators (the people who gave you          
    the account) are usually the ones best suited to answer questions of        
    this nature.  Other RELAY users and Operators may be able to help           
    you, but it is not their responsibility to know your individual             
    system and thus their information may not be correct for your local

<p>
   Because of the academic conferencing/usage purpose for RELAY's               
   existence, and because the network administrators for the host servers       
   may monitor any channel at any time, the rules of CREN (one of the           
   governing organizations of BITNET) must be followed at all times.            
   Since swearing is seen as non-academic and degrading, CREN disallows         
   its use over the network.

   Picture execs rapidly send messages to RELAY.  This tags the user as         
   being "hyperactive".  See the discussion of "hyperactivity" above.           
   Picture execs are not considered to be of academic use and therefore         
   are a breach of the CREN rules.

<A NAME="Q28"><b>Someone is harassing me.  What should I do about it?</b></a>                         
<p>
   There are a number of answers to this question, and the one which            
   is most appropriate varies from situation to situation.  The best            
   first step is generally to firmly inform the person who is bothering         
   you that you do not appreciate it and wish it stopped immediately.           
   If this is done in a polite manner, it is often enough to solve the          
   problem.  If the harassment persists, you have two options.  The             
   first and easiest recourse is to make use of RELAY's /IGNORE command         
   (e.g. /IGNORE BigJerk).  This will block out all RELAY messages from         
   the ignored user, informing him/her of the fact that (s)he has been          
   ignored.  The final option involves the intervention of a RELAY              
   Operator.  The /GETOP command can be useful in summoning an Operator         
   in this situation.  Explain the problem to the Operator who responds         
   and (s)he will try to resolve the problem.  Please note that a               
   "console log" (a system generated record of the messages you've sent         
   and received) can be very useful in proving harassment.  If you are          
   unsure how to create a console log, ask one of your local computer           
   center consultants.

<A NAME="Q29"><b>Can ops watch when they are not on a channel?</b></a>                                
<p>
   The only way for any user, including operators and Master Operators,         
   to see what is happening on another channel is to change to that             
   channel and watch the conversation.  Operators can not see private           
   conversations sent with /MSG, nor can they monitor channels where            
   they are not signed on.                                                      
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q30"><b>What are the differences between the user classes?</b></a>                           
<p>
   When you /REGISTER to RELAY, you get class 2 by default (at some hosts       
   it is class 1).  There are five conceptual class levels:                     
   <p>                                                                             
   <PRE>
   Class 0 - Banned from RELAY. Any user, whose class is 0, can not use         
             RELAY.                                                             
   Class 1 - A user who has previously been banned from RELAY and is            
             currently serving a probationary period.  OR A user whose          
             /REGISTER remains unconfirmed.  Channel access:  0 - 999.          
   Class 2 - The default class for /REGISTER. Channel access: 0 - 999.          
   Class 3 - A class granted to you by your host's MasterOp or any Op on        
             your host server who can provide you with that class.              
             Channel access: full range of negative and positive                
             channels.                                                          
   Classes 4 - 7 - General Operators, with different privileges according       
             to class.  Privileges granted at each level are decided by         
             the Master Op of each host.  Channel access: All channels,         
             same as in class 3.                                                
   Class 8 - MasterOp. Channel access: All channels as above.                   
   Class 9 - THE Master Operator for the individual server.  This is the        
             person responsible for the RELAY account and is the /CONTACT       
             for the RELAY server.                                              
   </PRE><p>

<A NAME="Q31"><b>How do I become an Operator?</b></a>                                                 
<p>
   Master Operators are the only people who may grant privileges of Class       
   4 or higher.  General Operators have neither the power nor the               
   authority to make you an op.  If there is more than one Master Op at         
   a host, they will confer before giving someone Operator status.  The         
   criteria used in choosing is sometimes site-dependent, eg. who may be        
   an op, or how many ops are allowed.  If you wish to be considered, you       
   may send e-mail to the person(s) listed in the response to /CONTACT.         
   Be patient and understanding if the answer is no.  You may elect to          
   ask again periodically, so you are the first person in mind when it          
   comes time to select a new operator.                                         
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             

<A NAME="Q32"><b>To whom do I talk if I have more questions 
or problems with RELAY?</b></a>           
<p>
   There are a number of places where you may find answers to other             
   questions.  Most simple questions can be answered by any Operator            
   signed onto RELAY at a given time.  In cases where the question              
   concerns specific policies of your RELAY host, or if there are no            
   Operators available, you may always send e-mail to your host's Master        
   Operator.  You may find the name and address of your MasterOp by             
   sending the /CONTACT command to your host.  Your MasterOp is also the        
   person to whom you should appeal in cases where you feel another             
   Operator did not handle a problem fairly.  Finally, a wealth of              
   information about RELAY's rules, its history, and its function can be        
   found in the files RELAY RULES, RELAY INFO, and RELAY USEGUIDE.              
   If you wish to join a discussion list for users of RELAY, then you           
   may join RELUSR-L at LISTSERV@NCSUVM.                                        
<p><center><A HREF="faq.html#top">[-go to top-]</A></center><HR>                                                                             
                                                                                
<A NAME="Q33"><b>What is RELUSR-L and how do I get in on it?</b></a>                                  
<p>
   RELUSR-L is forum for the discussion of RELAY related matters, carried       
   on through electronic mail.  Using a network server known as a               
   LISTSERV, RELUSR-L allows people interested in RELAY to converse with        
   each other, with all mail being distributed from two centralized             
   locations.  Subscription records are kept at each of these sites, and        
   LISTSERV insures that each subscriber gets a copy of every mailing to        
   RELUSR-L.  The two sites are LISTSERV@UALTAVM and LISTSERV@NCSUVM.           
   Canadian users are served by UALTAVM, while users in other areas are         
   served by NCSUVM.  The two sites interact to insure that subscribers         
   at both sites get the same mail.                                             
   The simplest way to subscribe to the list, or send any other type of         
   command is to send an interactive message to the LISTSERV.                   
   <p>                                                                             
   The syntax for Subscribing is as follows:                                    
   <p>
   <PRE>SUBscribe RELUSR-L <full name>                                            
   </PRE><p>                                                                         
   Example: (on a VM/CMS system)                                                
   <p>
   <PRE>TELL LISTSERV@NCSUVM SUBscribe RELUSR-L Joe Smith                         
   </PRE><p>                                                                        
      This will add the person sending the command to RELUSR-L and tell         
      LISTSERV that his name is Joe Smith.  It is important to remember         
      that all commands must be sent to LISTSERV, not RELUSR-L.  LISTSERV       
      will generally acknowledge the subscription with an interactive           
      message and then send you mail notifying you that you have been           
      added to the list.                                                        
      <p>                                                                     
   Once you have subscribed, LISTSERV will forward you a copy of all mail       
   sent over the list.  To reply to it or send your own mail, you simply        
   make use of whatever electronic mail facility your system supports,          
   and address the mail to RELUSR-L@NCSUVM (RELUSR-L@UALTAVM for                
   Canadians).<p>                                                                  
   Please try to post to RELUSR-L only matters of concern to the RELAY          
   community as a whole.  If you see a post about 'Link Failures' from          
   Joe Smith and have something to say on that topic, reply to the list.        
   But if Joe just happens to be a friend of yours and you want to ask          
   him how he has been, please ask him privately rather than over the           
   list.  This helps to save network bandwidth and also keeps list              
   subscribers from having to sort through posts that don't concern them.       
   <p>                                                               
   If you have further questions about RELUSR-L, send mail to Reba Taylor       
   (REBAT@VTVM1).  If you have more questions about LISTSERV in general,        
   send the 'INFO REFCARD' command to your nearest LISTSERV.
