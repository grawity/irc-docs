This help file is a general description of the Chat "Network conversation
 sifting facility" program -- what it is,  what it is NOT, and how to use
 it for the first time. Later,  when you have become experienced with the
 program, you will be able to  learn more from the other menu selections,
 but right now you will only need to read this file and the "PFkeys" file
 (and possibly  the "Layout" file too,  if you feel like  reading lots of
 help) before getting started.
 
In this  introductory file we will  assume that you are  already familiar
 with the standard IBM  TELL and NAMES commands and that  you know how to
 query about a user to see if he  is logged on. Well, at least you should
 have read the IBM helpfiles about  TELL and NAMES and roughly understood
 them -- you'll  see, Chat is even simpler (more  user-friendly) than the
 CMS commands for network communication...
 
In this  helpfile and in  all the other ones  we will use  the convention
 that "Chat" = the program, while  "chat" is the usual english word. Just
 in case you might come to get confused with the various meanings...
 
First of all you should get a general idea of what Chat does. Chat is not
 a multi-user Chat machine exec, such as  RELAY or FORUM -- nothing to do
 with channels,  /SIGNON commands, private  messages, etc. For  those who
 are familiar with  these programs, Chat is rather a  kind of full-screen
 TALKTO program  including a GONE-like  answering machine and  much more.
 But please don't feel discouraged if  you don't know anything about GONE
 and TALKTO -- you really don't need to!
 
 
Chat is a full-screen program that  will interface itself between you and
 the system to make your life a lot easier when conversing with people on
 the network. It  will receive messages for you, analyze  them, strip off
 the nasty unutterable system prefixes  (eg "DMTRGX171I" -- Yuk!), search
 your NAMES file for the nickname of  the person who sent the message and
 display it in ENGLISH:
 
 You'll get  "From Christina: Hello, how are you?"
 
 Instead of  "DMTRGX171I FROM CHZRZU1A(K345762): Hello, how are you?"
 
(Note: this  "Christina" is  an imaginary person,  please don't  send any
       mail to her!)
 
 
Furthermore, Chat will sort out the  messages you send and receive accor-
 ding to  the nickname of  the person you  are talking with,  and display
 them on  different "logical  screens" (up to  6 different  screens). You
 will be able to  switch from one logical screen to the  other at will by
 pressing a single PFkey. Those "screens"  are of the scrolling type, not
 the "MORE..." type,  so that you lose only one  message (the oldest one)
 when the screen becomes full.
 There is an independent command line  for each logical screen so that if
 you are typing  a message on a  given screen, you can  quickly switch to
 another one  if needed (eg to  answer an urgent message  from your boss)
 and then resume the message you had not finished typing by just pressing
 a PFkey (even the cursor position is preserved across screen switches!).
 
 
But anyway  you won't need to  switch screens or do  anything complicated
 for your first  use of Chat. And  you will only need to  learn about two
 PFkeys:
 
   - The "QUIT" PFkey is number 12. You can exit the Chat program anytime
      by just  pressing PF12.  Sorry about  the incompatibility  with the
      latest IBM standard, but you'll see the reason why QUIT is PF12 and
      not PF3 when learning the settings of the other PFkeys.
 
   - The "Switch to screen number 1" PFkey  is PF1 (you can use PF13 as a
      replacement if your terminal is one  of those where pressing PF1 is
      a real pain, and PF24 = PF12 too). PF1 will be your "home" key, the
      one to press if something goes  wrong and you don't understand what
      is happening to you. If  PF1 doesn't succeed, press the "emergency"
      PF12  key to  exit  from  Chat... and  feel  free  to have  another
      attempt!
 
Now read carefully before getting started. Find yourself a friend to chat
 with (preferably an experienced Chat user  on a console not too far from
 yours), and  define a nickname for  him using the NAMES  command (if not
 already done). Let's assume his nickname is "Mike" (why not?). When Mike
 is ready to chat  with you, quit the help files  and issue the following
 command: (guess what?)
 
       "CHAT"
 
You will  then be  presented with  a screen  with a  darned lot  of input
 fields (don't panic,  you won't have to  fill them all!) and  a bunch of
 repelling "options"  to set ON  or OFF and  you'll feel your  right hand
 irresistibly  going towards  the PF12  key...  No, not  now, you'd  miss
 something!...
 
Hopefully the cursor is placed on a field that doesn't look too bad -- it
 just reads "1. ________" -- and the fearsome option fields are far below
 the cursor...  Now just key-in  "Mike" (no  need to remove  the trailing
 underscores) and press the PF1 key.
 
The screen layout will then change to a familiar XEDIT-like command line,
 with "Screen number 1" being displayed  in the status area. And there is
 a nice "Tell  Mike" command in the  input area, with the  cursor just at
 the right position. And an empty screen with a red (or just hilighted if
 your console  is a monochrome one)  message saying that "This  screen is
 now dedicated to  Mike"... Let's have a try and  type "Hello, Mike!" and
 then ENTER.  You get  a red (intensified)  message saying  "Starting new
 Chat  session   on...",  then  a  green   (unintensified)  message  with
 "To   Mike: Hello, Mike!". Heck!!  That darned  program is  already mal-
 functionning, it  has put two  nasty spaces before "Mike"!  Doesn't look
 nice at all!
 
But  it did  send the  message to  Mike, no  problem there.  Some seconds
 later you get  a "From Mike: hiya!" (intensified  yellow) and understand
 why  there were  two  additional  blanks after  the  "To"... Don't  feel
 embarrassed for not having understood it  before when it was so obvious,
 some experienced VM users have had the same reaction before you...
 
Now you can Chat  with Mike as long as you want (you  just have to type a
 message,  press ENTER  and wait  for his  reply). Don't  stay too  long,
 though, because you could get into trouble if another user sent a messa-
 ge to you while you are trying Chat  -- you don't know yet how to handle
 multiple messages  from several users...  Not much trouble,  anyway; you
 would just  have to press your  "home" PF1 key, or  the "emergency" PF12
 key if you are really lost...
 
Ok, just try it now and come back  to that help file when you've done it.
 You'll then learn some more about multiple screens and screen switching.
 
 
 
Well... I guess that I should now change the header to

***********************************************************************
 
Now that you've learnt how to use Chat to communicate with a single user,
 you're probably wanting to learn more  about the program. If this is not
 the case, I apologize for having  bothered you with all that reading and
 testing and will be happy to get an angry mail from you (mail to ERIC at
 FRECP11).
 
The first  thing you will  have to learn is  the setting of  the "screen-
 switch" PFkeys:  as you might  have guessed,  PF2 switches to  screen 2,
 PF3 switches  to screen 3, (...)  PF6 switches to screen  6. This should
 not be  too difficult to  remember... That's  the reason why  the "quit"
 key is PF12, not  PF3: PF1 = screen 1, PF2 = screen2,  PF3 = quit, PF4 =
 screen 4 and PF12 = screen 3 would have been quite a mess...
 
Now assume you want to talk with Mike AND Christina. You get back to Chat
 by issuing a  "CHAT" command and find yourself back  where you had left.
 You could resume your conversation with  Mike if you wanted to. But it's
 with Christina that you want to talk  now. So you press the PF10 key and
 get back  to that unsightly  "nicknames screen".  The "1." field  is now
 filled with  Mike's nickname, userid and  node, and the cursor  has been
 subsequently  placed on  the second  field, which  reads  "2. ________".
 Quite logically, you  enter "Christina" in that field and  press the PF2
 key, in much  the same way as  you had entered "Mike" on  field number 1
 and pressed the PF1 key. You are presented with the second screen, which
 is now  dedicated to Christina  (of course you  know it is  dedicated to
 her!! That stupid  program doesn't need to print that  message!). So you
 start chatting  with Christina on  screen 2, impatiently waiting  to see
 what will happen when Mike sends a message...
 
Feeling yourself  daring, you  press the  PF1 key to  get back  to Mike's
 screen, tell  him to send  you a message, and  quickly sneak out  of his
 screen by pressing PF2... While you  were typing a message for Christina
 ("Well, I'm  waiting to s"),  you hear a beep,  look at the  console and
 realize that you have been switched back to Mike's screen... Here is the
 message you had  asked him to send. You quickly  answer "thanks" and get
 back to Christina's screen to see  what happened to the message you were
 keying in  when Mike's message came  in. It was apparently  removed from
 the command line while the program  switched back to Mike's screen... So
 you press the PF2 key and, lo  and behold, there it is, the message that
 you had  been typing  is now back  in the command  line with  the cursor
 placed in  the exact spot  where you had left  it... You can  now resume
 your message (..."to see what will happen when Mike sends a message")
 
So you  start relating your  experience with  Chat to Christina  when you
 hear a beep (again!),  look at the screen and find  yourself on screen 3
 (three???? Never said  I wanted to use that screen!!!!),  with the usual
 messages, "This screen  in now dedicated to Bob...",  "Starting new Chat
 session on..." and a message from that  guy who just wouldn't let you be
 yesterday at the party...  Curse him!! How do I get  rid of him? Perhaps
 an angry  message would  do it.  Such as "Sorry,  I'm busy,  another day
 please!"
 
You send that message and get back to screen 2. Getting curious about it,
 you press the PF10  key to get back to the  nicknames screen and realize
 that the  third field is now  filled in with Bob's  nickname, userid and
 node --  as if you had  yourself asked to  speak with that guy  (How did
 this stupid  program DARE think  that I might  be wanting to  speak with
 such a !"$!"+%!=!"$ ????)
 
Still cursing,  you press the PF2  key and start telling  Christina about
 this guy you can't manage to get  rid off when you are again pulled back
 to screen 3!  You press the PF2 key immediately,  without even caring to
 read the message --  and get pulled back to screen 3  again!! Bob is now
 sending a "love" picture to you!!!! And everytime you press PF2 to resu-
 me your  message you get switched  back to Bob's screen  because another
 message has arrived!!! Curse that darned program for being so stupid!
 
Hopefully the picture wasn't too long and  you had time to send a message
 to Mike  ("Help!! I'm beset  with messages from  everywhere!!!!") before
 receiving another  "kiss" picture from  Bob, which, along with  the help
 messages from Mike and the "What's up? You still there?" from Christina,
 makes the  terminal flash and  erratically jump  from one screen  to the
 other, beeping as if to announce Doomsday...
 
You helplessly wait for the bombing to end and switch to Mike's screen to
 read his messages. He tells you to go to the nicknames screen (Yuk!!)
 and change the "Automatic screen-switch" option to NO. Feeling that you
 really don't have any other choice, you press the PF10 key and blindly
 move the cursor towards those unsightly option fields, hoping that you
 will find the right one and won't do any mistake...
 
"NO" <ENTER>  Phewww... Made it...
 
About three seconds  after you have changed the option  to "NO", you hear
 a beep  (oh no! Not  again!) and  you see a  blinking yellow tag  at the
 bottom of the screen: "Incoming message on #3". But this time the screen
 doesn't switch!...  Good deal! You  neglect the blinking tag  and switch
 to Mike's screen  to tell him that  you have defeated Bob  and thank him
 for his irreplaceable  help... The "Incoming message on #3"  tag has now
 been replaced  with a stubborn  "Message pending on #3"  indication that
 keeps blinking in the status area...  Not knowing that Bob is an awfully
 nasty person with whom you don't  want to talk, Chat keeps reminding you
 that he has  sent you a message  and you didn't switch to  his screen to
 read it yet... But otherwise it's  convenient to have the nasty messages
 printed on another screen where you can choose NOT to switch to...
 
Well, now  you'd better be  trying all that  stuff before you  forget it.
 When you've  become accustomed to  it, you'll  be able to  wander though
 the other  helpfiles (start  with the  "Nicknames" file),  learning more
 about the  program -- "lentement, mais  surement" as we froggies  use to
 say...

This help file is a general description of the Chat "Network conversation
 sifting facility" program -- what it is,  what it is not, and how to use
 it. In this introductory file it will be assumed that you are proficient
 with the standard IBM TELL and NAMES commands.
 
To avoid a possible confusion  with several other (older) program bearing
 the same name, I would first like to state that Chat is not a multi-user
 chat machine exec such as RELAY or  FORUM -- nothing to do with that. It
 is rather  a kind of full-screen  TALKTO program which includes  a GONE-
 like answering machine, a message filtering program and much more. Apart
 from the usual RSCS message trimming and nickname-search, Chat will sort
 incoming and outcoming messages by  nicknames and display them on diffe-
 rent "logical screens". There are  6 different logical screens, and each
 of them can  be "dedicated" to a particular user.  Every message sent to
 or received from that user will be displayed on that screen and will not
 mess up the other screens. You can  switch from one screen to another by
 pressing the corresponding PFkey and the latest messages printed on that
 screen will  be re-displayed. There  is an independent command  line for
 each logical screen, which is  automatically pre-set to "Tell nickname",
 where "nickname"  is the nickname of  the person to which  the screen is
 dedicated. The contents of the command line is preserved (along with the
 position of the cursor) whenever you  switch from one screen to another.
 You can therefore switch to another screen to send an urgent message and
 switch back to the original screen  to resume typing your message. There
 is a special screen, called "screen 0", where all messages will be prin-
 ted regardless of nickname, thereby simulating the usual VM console out-
 put. Some  messages (eg  RSCS messages)  will be  automatically directed
 to this screen so as not to mess up the other screens.
 
Getting started  with Chat: assume  you want to  talk to user  Mike (from
 your NAMES file). All you will have  to do is enter Chat (by issuing the
 command: "CHAT"), type "Mike" in the first input field and press the PF1
 key. More  generally speaking, PFn will  switch you to screen  number n,
 and the  n-th input area on  the nicknames screen corresponds  to screen
 number n.  You will then  be able to chat  with Mike (the  messages will
 appear on  the screen  as soon  as they are  received), or  with several
 users at once. You  may exit Chat at any time by  pressing the PF12 key.
 If you ever receive a message from a user which has not yet been dedica-
 ted a screen, Chat will automatically  assign the first "free" screen to
 him and print the message there.
 
Probably the best thing to do now would  be to have a try at Chat. You'll
 then be  able to learn  more about it  by reading the  "Layout", "Tags",
 "Nicknames" and  "Options" helpfiles  (preferrably in that  order). Then
 you'll  have to  wade  through all  the other  helpfiles  when you  have
 time... Good luck!

The release 1.6 of Chat does not allow the user to change the settings of
 the  PA/PFkeys.  This  facility  will be  implemented  in  a  subsequent
 release.
 
 
The key settings are currently the following:
 
  CLEAR -- Re-display current screen. All screen modifications are lost.
 
  PA1   --  Nickname screen: Display the Chat HELP menu.
            Other    screen: Clear the screen output area. The input area
                              and cursor position are preserved.
 
  PA2   -- Enter CMS SUBSET  mode.  All messages  will be stacked and
            displayed upon return. Please note that incoming messages
            in excess of 255 will be irremediably lost to Chat due to
            CP limitations.
 
           The  CP/VMCONIO  settings will  be  turned  to OFF  before
            entering CMS SUBSET and possibly  changed back to IUCV if
            the  "Trap VM  and CP  output" option  is in  effect. You
            should never try to enter CMS SUBSET by entering "SUBSET"
            on  screen  0 (at  least  not  when  VM output  is  being
            trapped).
 
  PF1   -- Switch to Screen 1
  PF2   -- Switch to Screen 2
  PF3   -- Switch to Screen 3
  PF4   -- Switch to Screen 4
  PF5   -- Switch to Screen 5
  PF6   -- Switch to Screen 6
 
  PF7   -- Switch to previous screen
  PF8   -- Switch to next screen
 
  PF9   -- Switch to Screen 0
 
  PF10  -- Switch to Nicknames Screen.
 
  PF11  -- Force screen into holding status.
 
  PF12  -- Exit to CMS. The current settings, including nicknames and
            all screen displays,  will be preserved in  a file called
           "CHAT  LASTSESS A0"  and restored  at the  next invocation
            of Chat.
 
           Please note that  pressing the PF12 key  causes the screen
            modifications to  be lost (ie  not saved in  the LASTSESS
            file). You should therefore press the ENTER key, then the
            PF12 key  if you have  made modifications to  the screen,
            unless you  do not  care about  losing them.  This little
            annoyance is the consequence of  the "safety" of the PF12
            exit function that allows you to exit from Chat even when
            the screen format has been destroyed or is invalid (which
            can be the case if you use an unsupported console model).
            Would the modifications be analyzed and kept, there could
            be a  chance of your  being irremediably hung  in certain
            (critical) conditions.
 
 
  PF13 = PF1
  PF14 = PF2
     (...)
  PF24 = PF12
 
 
  ENTER --  Nickname screen: Validate screen modifications
            Other    screen: Execute the command typed in the input area
 
 
Note for french (and possibly other) users:
 
  PA1 = AP1 and PA2 = AP2
  PF1 = P1, etc.
  CLEAR = RAB MEM IN  (yuk!! Can't imagine a worse translation!)

Here is  a description  of the  "conversation screen"  layout and  of the
 meaning of the various colours/hilightings used by Chat.
 
 
Each of the six "conversation screens" is divided into three parts:
 
1) The "output area", which consist of  the first 22 (or 30, depending on
    physical screen size) lines. Both incoming and outbound messages will
    be printed on that area, as  well as possible other messages from the
    "system" (ie from  the Chat  program). This  area can  be cleared  by
    pressing the PA1 key.
 
2) The "input  area" (or "command  line"): This 132-character  input area
    allows you to  enter commands for Chat to execute.  If the screen has
    been dedicated to a particular  user, that area will be automatically
    filled  with  a  "Tell  nickname" command  whenever  emptied,  be  it
    manually (ERASE  INPUT + ENTER)  or as the  result of a  Chat command
    being executed.
 
3) The "status area",  located in the bottom right corner  of the screen.
    Chat will  always display  a tag  in that status  area (refer  to the
    "Tags" selection of main help menu  for more details on the subject).
 
 
 
Output area messages colour/hilight conventions:
 
- Outbound messages  (from you) are  displayed as nonhilighted  green and
   are  prefixed with  "To  Nickname: "  or  "<Your_relay_nickname> "  if
   the screen is a relay screen (see the "Relay" selection of main menu).
 
- Incoming messages  from YOU are  displayed on screen 0  as nonhilighted
   blue,  without any  header, unless  you have  specifically assigned  a
   screen to  yourself. Messages  from you  include Single  Console Image
   Facility (SCIF) messages and VM/CPCONIO output.
 
- Incoming messages  from other users  are displayed as  hilighted yellow
   and are prefixed  with "From Nickname: " (or unprefixed  if the screen
   is a relay one).
 
- Incoming  messages of  the "CP  WARNING"  class are  displayed as  red,
   hilighted and blinking  and are prefixed with  a "WNG From Nickname: "
   header.
 
  Furthermore,  a WARNING-class  message will  always cause  an automatic
   screen-switch to occur, regardless of the corresponding option setting
   (see "Options" selection from main help menu).
 
- Messages from the "system", including  text of user-entered Chat or CMS
   commands, are displayed as hilighted red.
 
- Messages from the  CHATFILT program (see the  "CHATFILT" selection from
   main menu for more details on that topic) are displayed on the current
   screen as  blue & nonhilighted or  red & hilighted, as  decided by the
   programmer.  See also  the  "SpecialCMD" selection  from the  commands
   menu for more information on these messages.

Chat will  often display a  tag in the status  area (at the  bottom right
 corner of the  screen) to tell you  when a message has  been received or
 when an error  has occured. Normal-condition tags are  green, error tags
 are  hilighted, blinking  red and  message receipt  ones are  hilighted,
 blinking yellow.
 
 
Here is a detailed description of the various tags:
 
- "Screen number n"                Green, nonhilighted, nonblinking
 
    This is the default  tag. It tells you the number  of the screen that
     is currently displayed.
 
 
- "*** Be patient ***"              Green, hilighted, blinking
 
    This tag is displayed when you  press the PA1 key while under control
     of the nicknames screen, thereby invoking the HELP function. Calling
     CMS to  format the help file  can take some seconds,  and you should
     NOT press  the ENTER key  until the  help screen is  displayed (that
     would place you in VM READ status and possibly insert unwanted blank
     lines in the help text).
 
 
- "*** Too long  ***"               Green, hilighted, blinking
 
    This tag is displayed when the  message you are attempting to send is
     too long  for RSCS (Chat got  a "RSCS NOT RECEIVING;  MSG TOO LARGE"
     error  from CP).  You  should  move the  cursor  back  and insert  a
     "logical message-end  character" (see "Options" helpfile  from menu)
     somewhere in the message, or reduce its length by erasing part of it
     the input area is preserved).
 
 
- "Incoming message on #n"         Yellow, hilighted, blinking
 
    This tag  informs you that a  NEW message has just  been received and
     directed to the  indicated screen. You should switch  to that screen
     as soon as  you have finished typing the message  or set of messages
     that you are currently keying in. Anyway, Chat will remind you about
     that message  until you switch to  the specified screen to  read it,
     possibly entering "holding" status to ensure that the message is not
     lost (see below).
 
    These  tags are  displayed  as the  messages  are received,  possibly
     overriding a previous tag.
 
 
- "Message pending on #n"          Yellow, hilighted, blinking
 
    This tag informs  you that there is  a message waiting to  be read on
     the  indicated screen.  This is  a  message for  which an  "Incoming
     message" tag has already been displayed  -- and you have ignored it.
     You should  switch to  the appropriate screen  to read  that message
     after finishing  the message  or set of  messages you  are currently
     typing.
 
    When  a  message-pending condition  occurs  on  several screens,  the
     message-pending tags are displayed in ascending screen-number order,
     with only one tag being displayed  at a given instant (ie if screens
     1, 3 and 6 have  a pending message condition, the tag  for screen #1
     will be displayed until you move to screen 1, at which time the tag
     for screen #3 will be displayed, etc.)
 
 
- "*** Holding ***"                Yellow, hilighted, blinking
 
    When this  tag is  displayed, you are  automatically switched  to the
     appropriate  screen (regardless  of  the  "Automatic screen  switch"
     option  setting), the  bell is  rung and  all incoming  messages are
     withheld on ALL screens until  you press an interrupting key (ENTER,
     PF, et al.) You  must then make sure you have  read all the messages
     on  that screen  and press  ENTER to  release the  condition. Normal
     scrolling will then be resumed,  possibly leading to another holding
     condition. Note that while the screen is held and message receipt is
     withheld, messages in  excess of 255 will be lost  due to CP limita-
     tions.
 
    If the "Scrolling  window" option is set to something  higher than 1,
     there might be unused blank lines at  the top of the screen when the
     holding condition occurs. This is normal since in that case, several
     lines will be scrolled at once  when the holding condition is relea-
     sed (ie this is NOT a bug).
 
- "*** Error ***"                  Red, hilighted, blinking
 
    This tag indicates  an error condition in a command  you typed in the
     command line (eg missing nickname or message text on "Tell" command,
    "Dismiss" command attempted  from screen 0, et al.)  The command line
     is not erased so that you can correct the command and re-execute it.

***********************************************************************
 
In this file you will find information about the conventions used by Chat
 for  displaying "network  addresses" (ie  nickname or  userid at  node),
 together  with some  information on  Chat's re-routing  capabilities and
 SMSG/SEND/CP TO commands support.
 
 
I) Displaying nicknames
 
When Chat  receives a message  from a network  user, it will  search your
 NAMES file for the nickname corresponding to that user. If none is found
 it will have  to display the network address "as  is". The nickname will
 be converted  to mixed  case before being  printed, using  the following
 algorithm:
 
   - First letter in the nickname and first letter following a non alpha-
      betical character gets capitalized.
 
   - All other letters are converted to lowercase.
 
Examples:  Christina, Mr.Brown, Jean-Jacques
 
The maximum nickname  length under Chat is 14 characters.  This will make
 it possible to use the person's  first name in (nearly) any case without
 having to  truncate it. Since  the standard  IBM NAMES command  does not
 support nicknames longer  than 8 characters, it  is strongly recommended
 that the Chat-NAMES command be used to maintain the NAMES file, at least
 when nicknames longer  than 8 characters are to  be added/changed. Refer
 to  the "CHATNAME"  selection from  main menu  for more  details on  the
 Chat-NAMES package.
 
If no nickname  could be found for the message  originator, the full net-
 work address  (USERID at NODE) will  be substituted, with the  "at NODE"
 prefix  being removed  if the  message originated  from the  local node.
 Additionally, Chat will automatically (and temporarily) assign a special
 nickname to that user so that you  don't have to repeat the full network
 address each time you send a  message to him. That special nickname will
 be either ":n" or "Relay:n", where "n"  is the number of the screen that
 was automatically assigned to the user. The latter form is used when the
 userid of  the message originator is  "RELAY" and allows you  to get the
 "relay-format" output  without having to  define an actual  nickname for
 that user. See the "Relay" selection  from main menu for more details on
 the subject.
 
 
Therefore:
 
Nickname          --  nickname from your NAMES file
USERID at NODE    --  full network address for a user which is not in
                      your NAMES file
USERID            --  user of your own node which is not in your NAMES
                      file
:n                --  special (temporary) nickname defined for a user not
                      in your NAMES file
Relay:n           --  same as above, corresponds to an originator-userid
                      of "RELAY"
 
 
Please note that although a "special nickname" can be used for communica-
 ting with its associated user in much the same way as a normal nickname,
 messages to and from this user are still displayed with the full network
 address, viz USERID at NODE.
 
 
II) Assigning/un-assigning screens
 
Chat will automatically  assign a new screen  to any user who  sent you a
 message and has not yet been dedicated a screen (but this can be changed
 by means  of the Chat  message filtering  program -- see  the "CHATFILT"
 selection from main  menu for more details). You will,  however, have to
 manually assign screens to new users  when you want to initiate the con-
 versation. To do this, you will have to switch to the "nicknames screen"
 by pressing the PF10 key; Chat  will then automatically place the cursor
 on the  field corresponding to  the first  empty screen (unless  all six
 screens have been assigned), and you  will just have to enter the user's
 nickname or network address (see  conventions above) and press the ENTER
 key. You  can then  switch to  that screen  and start  sending messages.
 A message will be displayed, both on the selected screen and on screen 0
 confirming that the screen was assigned.
 
To un-assign a screen, you can either:
 
   (1) Switch to the nicknames screen,  move the cursor to the correspon-
        ding field,  type a (single) blank  and press the ENTER  key. The
        corresponding screen will  be freed but not cleared  (ie its con-
        tents will remain unaltered).
 
   (2) Switch to the screen you want to get rid of and type either "Drop"
        or "Dell" right after the arrow.  The latter can be achieved very
        easily by pressing  the backward-field ("|<--") key  and typing a
        "D" over the  "T" of "Tell". The screen will  then be cleared and
        un-assigned.  See the  "Drop" and  "Dismiss" selections  from the
        commands menu for more details.
 
 
The "R." field  does not correspond to any message-screen.  It is used in
 conjunction with relays and contains the relay-nickname you are current-
 ly using. Refer to the "Relay" selection from main menu for more details
 on this.
 
 
III) Re-routing facility
 
It may  sometimes be necessary to  override the default path  used by the
 system to convey your messages to the  person you intend to talk to, for
 example when  one of  the lines  in this path  is not  operational. This
 operation is  called "re-routing"  and allows you  to have  the messages
 sent "via" a specific node of  the network. This re-routing is not auto-
 matic since you  must determine yourself which  node is to be  used as a
 "via" to allow the message to get through.
 
Once you  have determined that there  is a problem with  the default path
 and you have chosen a suitable  "via" node, you must provide this infor-
 mation by re-assigning the appropriate  screen to "nickname via vianode"
 instead of  just "nickname", where  "vianode" is  the node you  want the
 messages routed  via. Example: you  (CHATUSER at FRECP11)  were speaking
 with your friend Sylvia  (S_KRONER at AUVM) when on of  the links on the
 default path  to her (DEARN  - GWUVM) suddenly  went down. You  call for
 help and the network operator tells you to try to re-route your messages
 via  BITNIC. You  change the  nicknames-screen entry  for Sylvia,  which
 looked like this:
 
      1. Sylvia             (S_KRONER at AUVM)
 to
      1. Sylvia             (S_KRONER at AUVM via BITNIC)
 
 by entering  "Sylvia via bitnic"  in the corresponding input  area. Chat
 will then  automatically re-route all  your messages to her  via BITNIC.
 
 
*** Important notes ***
 
1) Chat  will  not automatically  reset  the  "via" indication  when  the
    failing line is  available again. It is your  responsibility to check
    the default path from time to  time and to reset the "via" indication
    (by re-entering  the initial definition in  the appropriate nicknames
    screen field  -- just "Sylvia"  in our  example) when the  link comes
    back.
 
2) All your messages will be traced to  the RSCS console log when you use
    re-routing.  This means  that the  system operator  can (technically)
    intrude into your private conversation --  or he might as well hapha-
    zardly stumble on one of  your messages while searching for something
    else, without meaning to "eavesdrop" or anything.
 
3) A "via" indication  can be made permanent by defining  a ":via" tag in
    the corresponding  entry of your  NAMES file, with the  "via-node" as
    value. In the above example, you would have to add a
 
      "Tag: VIA          Value: BITNIC"
 
    line in  Sylvia's entry (if using  NAMES; if you use  XEDIT to modify
    your NAMES file, this will  be a ":via.BITNIC" indication). Note that
    an explicit "via nodeid" entered along with the user's address on the
    nickname screen will override the NAMES file indication.
 
4) This Sylvia  Kroner is an imaginary  person, please don't try  to send
    mail or IDCARDs there!
 
 
IV) Alternate message vehicles for messages sent to local users
 
Chat will, by  default, send messages to  users of the local  node with a
 CP  MSG command,  which will  display a  5-lines message  to the  user's
 terminal with time  stamp and message text. This is  a fast and reliable
 way of displaying  messages, and it will work on  any VM/SP system (this
 is a standard IBM command). It will, however, quickly fill up the screen
 with blank  lines and time  stamps (4 messages fill  up the screen  on a
 24-lines display station). You might  therefore prefer to have Chat send
 messages via  RSCS (as if  the user were from  a remote node),  in which
 case they  will appear  as single-line messages  with the  standard RSCS
 header. Please note that  because of a bug in the  RSCS system, you will
 get no error message if the target user  is not logged on or did not re-
 receive the message. Also, the message will not be sent if the RSCS sys-
 tem is  down or has crashed.  If you want  Chat to send the  message via
 RSCS, you  must specify  a "fake" re-routing  indication of  "via RSCS",
 either by  entering it on the  nicknames screen or defining  a "via" tag
 with value  "RSCS" in the NAMES  file entry corresponding to  this user.
 
Some nodes on the network have installed a general-user command, "CP TO",
 which  will send  a one-line  message with  time stamp  and originator's
 userid. This command  is much better than "via RSCS"  because the header
 will be shorter and you will not have to depend on the RSCS system being
 operational. It  will also reduce system  overload. Chat can be  made to
 use that  command by specifying  a "via  CPTO" indication for  the user.
 Please note that if  the "CP TO" command is not  available at your node,
 no message will be sent and the alarm will be rung to indicate there was
 an error.
 
Sometimes it can be useful to  use Chat to communicate with "conversatio-
 nal" system accounts  such as PVM, MAILER, auto-operator,  etc, which do
 not accept  commands sent via regular  messages. It is possible  to have
 Chat automatically  use the "CP  SMSG" command when sending  messages by
 specifying a "via SMSG" indication, preferrably in the user's NAMES file
 entry (so that the indication is permanent).
 
A similar facility is offered to users who have "secondary user" privile-
 ges on one or more virtual machines and want to communicate with them by
 means of  the "CP SEND"  command: a  re-routing statement of  "via SEND"
 will  cause Chat  to use  the "CP  SEND" command  when "talking"  to the
 corresponding user. Here  again, it would be better to  include a tag in
 your NAMES file to make the change permanent. Refer to the available IBM
 help for more details on the "CP SEND" command.
 
Last, but not least, the default message vehicle ("CP MSG" command) can
 be changed to either "RSCS" or "CP TO" by defining a dummy entry in your
 NAMES file with nickname = any value (will be ignored), userid = '*',
 node = local node and an adequate "via" tag. For example, the default of
 "CP MSG" could be changed to "CP TO" by adding the following entry into
 your NAMES file:
 
 Nickname: Default_Via  Userid: *       Node: FRECP11
 Tag: VIA               Value: CPTO
 
 (assuming your own network address is CHATUSER at FRECP11)
 
 Since this  setting will be extracted  from your NAMES file  only during
 initialization (this being for  obvious performance considerations), you
 will have  to quit Chat  and re-enter it  to place any  "default message
 vehicle" change online if it was made from within Chat.

In this file  you will find information about  the various user-definable
 options of  Chat (those that  are listed  on the nicknames  screen). The
 settings of these options are saved  in the LASTSESS file, together with
 the screen contents and associated  nicknames, and will be automatically
 re-activated at the next invocation of Chat.
 
 
Automatic screen switch
 ---------------------
 
This option indicates whether Chat  will automatically switch the screens
 upon receipt  of a  message. The  initial setting  is YES,  meaning that
 whenever a  message is received,  the input  area of the  current screen
 will be  saved and  the screen  corresponding to  the message-originator
 will be  automatically displayed. It  is strongly recommended  that this
 option be changed to NO as soon  as you become proficient with Chat. The
 reason why the  initial setting is YES  is that it allows  a novice Chat
 user to get out of a screen  he has inadvertently switched to as soon as
 he receives a  message (eg from an experienced user  teaching him how to
 use the program). Setting  this option to YES can be  useful if you have
 logged on  to VM only  to receive  (possible) messages from  other users
 while you are busy doing something else.
 
When this option is set to "NO",  an "Incoming message on #n" tag will be
 displayed in  the status area  whenever a  new message is  received. You
 will then be reminded about all  messages that you have not already seen
 by a  "Message pending  on #n" tag  in the status  area. See  the "Tags"
 selection from main menu for more details on those tags.
 
Note that the screen will  still be automatically switched, regardless of
 the setting of this option, whenever a screen enters "Holding" status or
 you receive a "CP WARNING" from a system operator.
 
 
Ring alarm upon screen switch
 ---------------------------
 
This option  controls whether Chat will  ring the bell when  an automatic
 screen switch  occurs. The default value  is YES, and it  is recommended
 that it  be left active unless  you leave the "Automatic  screen switch"
 option active  too. You will  therefore be informed of  any "unexpected"
 automatic screen switch caused by  a holding condition on another screen
 or by a warning from a system operator.
 
 
Ring alarm upon message receipt
 -----------------------------
 
This option  controls whether Chat  will ring  the bell when  an incoming
 message has  been received. The default  option is YES, and  its setting
 is only a matter of personal taste.
 
 
Keep a log of all transactions
 ----------------------------
 
When this option is set to  YES, all incoming and outcoming messages will
 be logged in separate disk files ("nickname LOG" or "ALL LOG" for screen
 0 messages). The default setting is NO.  You should be aware of the fact
 that changing this option to YES is likely to use up an important amount
 of disk space, especially if you  often use RELAY. Note that this option
 will be automatically cancelled (to avoid repeated error messages) when-
 ever a severe  disk error occurs (eg disk full,  disk not accessed, disk
 is R/O). Also,  messages issued by the CHATFILT  filtering program (qqv)
 will not be logged to disk. The filemode of the LOG files can be changed
 by means of the "Chat log filemode" option (see below).
 
 
Translate: Input to lowercase
 ---------------------------
 
This option should be set to YES  if (and only if) you use an all-upperca
 se terminal. This will cause your  output to be translated to lowercase,
 with capital letters being inserted  wherever required, ie at the begin-
 ning  of the  sentence, after  punctuation marks  (!?.) and  whenever an
 isolated "i" appears. Example:
 
    HERE'S A SAMPLE SENTENCE. CHAT WILL MAKE IT NEATER, I'M SURE IT WILL!
 
--> Here's a sample sentence. Chat will make it neater, I'm sure it will!
 
 
Trap VM and CP output
 -------------------
 
This option  controls whether VMCONIO  and CPCONIO output are  trapped by
 Chat or not (if you do not  know what VM/CPCONIO means, you should leave
 that option disabled). The default value  is NO, and only experienced VM
 users should consider  changing it to YES if necessary.  Note that it is
 not possible to issue a "CP SET VM/CPCONIO OFF/IUCV" command from within
 Chat  since the  preset value  for these  options will  automatically be
 re-inforced by Chat after execution of a CMS command (in case a "stupid"
 exec might have  tampered with them). Chat will  automatically turn both
 options off before entering CMS SUBSET  (PA2 key) so that you are resto-
 red to  the normal  CMS environment.  Please note  that VM/CP  output in
 excess of 255  lines will be directly  output to the screen  (as if they
 had not  been trapped at  all). This is  a restriction of  the operating
 system.
 
When trapped,  VM/CP output will be  printed to screen 0  as blue, normal
 intensity. It will  be logged to the "ALL LOG"  file (if applicable). It
 will not be  passed to the CHATFILT filtering program  (qqv) for proces-
 sing.
 
The author will not feel responsible for any hanging/loop condition occur
 ring under  Chat with this option  active, unless it can  be proved that
 the problem was due to a bug  in Chat rather than to the inexperience of
 the user.
 
 
Message-end char
 --------------
 
The  logical message-end  character, if  defined, allows  you to  split a
 message line  into several "physical"  messages to  be sent to  the same
 user. For example, if the message-end character is set to "%", issuing a
 "Tell Eric  Hello!%How are you?%Did  you get  my note?" will  send three
 different messages to user Eric and is virtually equivalent to:
 
  "Tell Eric Hello!"
  "Tell Eric How are you?"
  "Tell Eric Did you get my note?"
 
This option  is particularly useful on  slow modem terminals where  it is
 necessary to minimize the number of I/O operations. The default value is
 OFF.
 
 
PF-keys simulation
 ----------------
 
This option  should be  activated if (and  only if) you  use Chat  from a
 terminal which does not have any PF-key. It will allow you to "simulate"
 a PF-key depression  by entering its number in the  command line, either
 directly after the "===>" arrow or  just after a "Tell nickname" command
 and pressing the ENTER key. For example, both
 
     "===> 10"
 and "===> Tell Eric 10"
 
 will "press" the PF10 key. Since there is no input area on the nicknames
 screen which would allow you to switch to a message-screen by typing its
 number and  pressing ENTER, it  was decided that pressing  ENTER without
 altering any field will switch you from the nicknames screen to screen 0
 (from where you will be able to switch to any other screen). Please note
 that inserting a blank before a  numeric value in a "Tell nickname" com-
 mand  will disallow  PF-key simulation,  as will  any character  entered
 after the numeric value itself, making it possible to send messages star
 ting with  numeric values to a  user even though the  PF-keys simulation
 option is active. For example,
 
     "===> Tell Eric  10"
and  "===> Tell Eric 10 miles away."
 
 will both be processed as regular messages.
 
 
Scrolling window
 --------------
 
This option  indicates how many  lines should  be scrolled when  the last
 line of the screen  has been used and another line  must be printed. The
 default value  is 1  line and  causes a  line-per-line scrolling.  It is
 strongly recommended that this value be increased to 6 or more when Chat
 is used  from a slow  terminal, since it will  reduce I/O transfer  in a
 significant proportion  (see the  "Modem" selection  from main  menu for
 more details).  The best way  to understand how this  "scrolling window"
 actually operates is probably to try setting it to 5 or so and observing
 the result...
 
 
Line-end character
 ----------------
 
Similar  to the  message-end  character, the  logical line-end  character
 allows you to enter more than  one Chat/CMS command on a single physical
 line, thereby decreasing the number  of I/O operations required to enter
 the  commands. This  option is  strictly  identical to  the CP  TERMINAL
 LINEND feature. The default setting is OFF.
 
 
Translate: Output to uppercase
 ----------------------------
 
You should set this option to YES  if (and only if) your terminal is una-
 ble to handle lowercase characters properly. It will convert any and all
 screen output to uppercase, thereby effecting  a software "A,a / A" key.
 
 
Chat log filemode
 ---------------
 
When used in conjunction with the "Keep a log of all transactions" featu-
 re, this  option allows you  to change the  default filemode to  be used
 for the "nickname LOG"  files. The default is "A" and  can be changed to
 anything in  the A-Z range as  required. Please note that  specifying an
 invalid filemode will cause an error  message (from CMS) to be displayed
 and  will automatically  cancel the  "Keep  a log  of all  transactions"
 option (to avoid repeated error messages).

Here is a detailed description of all the messages from Chat. Please note
 that status area "tags" are dealt with in another section.
 
 
- "This screen is now dedicated to Nickname (userid at node)"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message is automatically issued by  Chat whenever a new screen is
    allocated to a user,  be it manually (if you entered  his name on the
    nicknames screen)  or automatically (if he  sent you a message  and a
    new screen could be allocated for him).
 
 
- "Screen number n now dedicated to Nickname (userid at node)"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message is  displayed on screen 0 whenever a  screen is allocated
    to a user, while the preceding message ("This screen is now dedicated
    to...") is issued on the corresponding screen.
 
 
- "Starting new Chat session on mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   Whenever Chat must print something on  a screen which had not yet been
    modified since  you last entered  Chat, it  will be preceded  by that
    message to introduce a discontinuity in  the screen as well as in the
    corresponding log-file (if any). That way  you will always be able to
    tell when a break occured in  any given conversation, and when it was
    resumed.
 
 
- "Disconnected at mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message  will be  displayed after you  issue a  Chat "Disconnect"
    command to provide a useful time  stamp. It will appear only on those
    screens which have been modified during your disconnection.
 
 
- "Reconnected  at mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss -- nnn message(s) on this screen"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message  will be displayed  upon reconnection from a  Chat "Disc-
    onnect" command  to indicate  the amount of  messages that  were dis-
    played on  the corresponding  screen during your  disconnection. This
    information is  very useful since  some of them might  have "scrolled
    out" of  the physical screen. It  will not be printed  on the screens
    which have not been altered during your disconnection.
 
 
- "Unknown CP/CMS command"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   Similar to  its CMS equivalent,  this message indicates that  you have
    attempted a command that is unknown both to Chat and to CMS.
 
 
- "Invalid SUBSET command"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   Similar to  its CMS equivalent,  this message indicates that  you have
    attempted  a CMS  command  that is  not valid  when  issued from  CMS
    "SUBSET" mode.  Note that this  can only  happen if you  have invoked
    Chat from CMS SUBSET mode, in  which case a warning message will have
    been displayed at initialization.
 
 
- "Chat: command_text"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This  message indicates  that the  command you  have entered  has been
    interpreted as being  a Chat command and was executed.  This does not
    necessarily mean that it executed successfully, though: another error
    message might follow.
 
 
- "CMS: command_text"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This  message indicates  that the  command you  have entered  has been
    interpreted as  being a CMS command  and was executed. This  does not
    necessarily mean that it executed successfully, though: another error
    message might follow.
 
 
- "Missing argument"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message is  self-explanatory, and relates only  to Chat commands.
 
 
- "Invalid argument"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message is  self-explanatory, and relates only  to Chat commands.
    Typical invalid arguments  are: userid or node longer  than 8 charac-
    ters, non-decimal argument, invalid CMS fileid, etc.
 
 
- "File not found"
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message  is self-explanatory.  It relates  to the  Chat "Picture"
    command.
 
 
- "Warning -- disk-logging option has been cancelled."
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   A  permanent error  occured while  writing  to a  disk logfile.  Since
    repeated attempts to  write to the logfile disk (as  specified by the
    "Chat log filemode" option on nicknames screen -- see "Options" selec
    tion from main menu for more details on the subject) would only cause
    repeated  occurences of  the error,  and consequently  repeated error
    messages, the  disk-logging option has been  automatically cancelled.
    You should  correct the problem  and set it  back to "YES"  to resume
    disk logging.
    Typical permanent  errors are:  "disk not  accessed", "disk  is R/O",
    "disk is full",  etc. Note that "invalid character in  fileid" is not
    considered as a  permanent error since it might affect  only a speci-
    fic logfile (invalid character in nickname).
 
 
- "Warning: you have entered Chat from CMS SUBSET mode."
 
      (red, hilighted)
 
   This message  is self-explanatory  and is displayed  at initialization
    when the  CMS SUBSET mode is  found to be active.  Chat will function
    correctly under  CMS SUBSET  but some commands  might be  rejected by
    CMS.

- "DMSCHT001E Not enough storage to start Chat."
 
   This message is  self-explanatory. There is no other  solution than to
    free some storage space and call  Chat again. This can be achieved by
    exiting XEDIT,  FILELIST, RDRLIST, NAMES, or  any similar environment
    that requires  a lot of  storage; a  "NUCXDROP *" command  might free
    a little space,  and releasing some (unused) disks  would probably be
    very efficient.
 
 
- "DMSCHT002E Chat should not be called recursively."
 
   You have  attempted to call  Chat recursively, issusing a  second CHAT
    command from either  the Chat environment itself  or another environ-
    ment (such as  XEDIT or RDRLIST) that you had  previously called from
    Chat. In that case you will get back to Chat by successively quitting
    one (or more) environment.
 
 
- "DMSCHT003E Error calling HNDIUCV."
 
   The  CMS internal  command "HNDIUCV"  returned an  error condition  to
    Chat. You should try  to call Chat anew after a  "cold" start of your
    virtual machine (ie log off the  system and log on again). Contact an
    experienced Chat  user or  a system  programmer if  you get  the same
    error again.
 
 
- "DMSCHT004E Error calling CMSIUCV."
 
   The  CMS internal  command "CMSIUCV"  returned an  error condition  to
    Chat. You should try  to call Chat anew after a  "cold" start of your
    virtual machine (ie log off the  system and log on again). Contact an
    experienced Chat  user or  a system  programmer if  you get  the same
    error again.
 
 
- "DMSCHT005E Error calling HNDINT."
 
   The  CMS internal  command  "HNDINT" returned  an  error condition  to
    Chat. You should try  to call Chat anew after a  "cold" start of your
    virtual machine (ie log off the  system and log on again). Contact an
    experienced Chat  user or  a system  programmer if  you get  the same
    error again.
 
 
- "DMSCHT006E Path to "*MSG" unexpectedly severed."
 
   The IUCV-path to  the Message System Service  handler was unexpectedly
    severed. You  should try to  call Chat anew  after a "cold"  start of
    your  virtual machine  (ie  log off  the system  and  log on  again).
    Contact an  experienced Chat user or  a system programmer if  you get
    the same error again.
 
 
- "DMSCHT007W Charlot is in place and already trapped by another program"
 
   You have  tried to invoke Chat  with the Charlot program  being active
    and  already "trapped"  by  another  message-processing program.  The
    status of the Charlot trap has been left unchanged. You should termi-
    nate the  program that is  currently trapping Charlot and  re-issue a
    CHAT command. A "Charlot Terminate" command,  or a cold start of your
    virtual machine (log off and log  on again) will clear the problem if
    the trapping program has abended.
 
 
- "DMSCHT008W You must issue a "CHAT NEW" command to place your new
              version online."
 
   You have received a new version of  the Chat package on your disk, and
    the version  that is currently loaded  in your virtual storage  is an
    obsolete one.  You should issue a  "CHAT NEW" command to  discard the
    version in your virtual storage and  place the new one online. If the
    problem  persists, try  to order  the "CHAT  EXEC" and  "CHAT MODULE"
    files from Netserv,  receive them, and try again.  Contact the author
    if this does not fix the problem.
 
- "DMSCHT009E Chat was started in disconnected mode with console stack
              empty."
 
   You have started  Chat while your virtual machine  was in disconnected
    mode (probably from your PROFILE  EXEC, after being AUTOLOG-ged), and
    the console stack was found to be empty. Chat is not able to function
    in disconnected mode, except when  under control of the Chat "Discon-
    nect" command, since it obtains command from the virtual console. The
    only way to have Chat function from a disconnected virtual machine is
    to stack a  "Disconnect <message-text>" command in  the console stack
    prior to  invoking it.  Refer to the  "CHATDISC" selection  from main
    menu and to  the "DISConn" selection from the commands  menu for more
    details.
 
 
- "DMSCHT010E Chat cannot be used on a teletype terminal."
 
   You have started  Chat from a teletype terminal (ie  one without full-
    screen  capabilities).  Chat  requires  a  full-screen  terminate  to
    operate properly.
 
 
- "DMSCHT011E Error reading NAMES file."
 
   An I/O error  occured while reading your NAMES file  into storage. You
    should  try to  enter  Chat again  and, if  the  error occurs  again,
    contact your system support personnel.
 
 
- "DMSCHT012E Cannot read NAMES file from a CDF (blksize 800) disk."
 
   Chat uses a very efficient method to read your NAMES file. This method
    is about  10 times faster  than the  "normal" one, but  for technical
    reasons it  cannot work on old  "CDF" architecture disks. If  you get
    this message, you should  probably consider re-formatting your A-disk
    to "EDF"  architecture (ie blocksize  512, 1k,  2k or 4k).  This will
    result in faster and more reliable  I/O operations from CMS. CDF disk
    support has been kept in CMS only for upwards compatibility reasons.

Chat  requires VM/SP  Release 3  or above  for all  of its  components to
 function properly. VM/SP  2 is not suitable since it  lacks the CMS IUCV
 support (HNDIUCV and  CMSIUCV system macros). There is  no problem about
 running Chat on a VM/SP 4 system -- on the contrary, better performances
 can be expected on  a VM/SP 4 system due to  CHATFILT and CHATDISC being
 EXECLOADed by CHAT EXEC.
 
 
Console support:  Chat should  support any  kind of  full-screen terminal
 with a "decent" screen size. All  data streams have been optimized so as
 to  ensure fastest  possible I/O  response  time and  best operator  eye
 comfort. Model 5 terminals (27x132) are supported in 24x80 compatibility
 mode only.
 
Supported models are:
 
  3277-2 (no blinking, no colour, 24 lines)
  3178-2 (no blinking, no colour, 24 lines)
  IBM PC (no blinking, no colour, 24 lines)
  3190   (no blinking, no colour, 24 lines, in 4-sessions mode only)
 
  3278-2 (blinking, no colour, 24 lines)
  3278-3 (blinking, no colour, 32 lines)
  3278-4 (blinking, no colour, 43 lines)
  3278-5 (no blinking, no colour, supported in 24x80 mode only)
 
  3279-2 (blinking, colour, 24 lines)
  3279-3 (blinking, colour, 32 lines)
  3279-4 (blinking, colour, 43 lines)
  3279-5 (no blinking, basic-colour, supported in 24x80 mode only)
 
  3179-G (blinking, colour, various user-definable modes)
  3180   (blinking, no colour, various user-definable modes)
 
  3278-2A (no blinking, no colour, 20 lines)
  3279-2C (no blinking, basic-colour, 20 lines)
 
Models known NOT to be supported:
 
  3277-1 (12 lines, 40 columns -- screen is too small)
  3190   (in native mode, a 3190 is supported only as a 24x80 device in
          "big characters" mode)
 
 
On the  above table, "blinking"  only indicates whether Chat  can support
 the feature at all on this type  of terminal or not. Some terminals mar-
 ked as "blinking"  might still not have any  blinking capability because
 of the controller  they are connected to. A console  marked as "no blin-
 king" might  have blinking capabilities  but Chat  would not be  able to
 use them. Similarly, "colour" indicates that 7-colours mode is supported
 if available.
 
Chat might  still function on other  console models. As a  rule of thumb,
 Chat should be  able to handle any 3270-compatible  console which either
 has a  24x80 compatibility  mode or  has a physical  screen width  of 80
 columns or less and not less  than 20 physical lines. Consoles with more
 than 43 lines will be supported in 43-lines mode.
 
Please report to the author (Eric  Thomas <ERIC@FRECP11>) if you have any
 console support problem (Chat can  handle both new-format and old-format
 data streams, the only problem being to select the correct one).
 
 
 
Removal of unwanted control characters: Chat changes all characters whose
 EBCDIC code is in  the X'00' --> X'3F' range to  blanks to avoid hanging
 the console.  This can  result in  special (printable)  characters being
 changed to blanks on some console  models, but the same characters would
 hang some modem-using emulators...
 
 
Storage  requirements: Chat  uses a  free  storage work  buffer of  about
 30k-bytes.  The total  storage space  used up  by Chat  is approximately
 45k-bytes (program + buffer).
 
 
CPU  time consideration:  Chat is  an assembler  language program  and is
 therefore much  faster than any  equivalent REXX or even  EXEC2 program.
 There are, however,  some operations that intrinsically  require a large
 amount of  CPU time. The following  steps can be taken  to reduce Chat's
 CPU usage if really necessary:
 
 
1) Turn the "Automatic screen-switch" option off.
 
2) Set the "Scrolling window" option to a larger value.
 
3) Avoid using a CHATFILT exec -- erase it or make it the simplest possi-
    ble. Do not  issue any CPU-time consuming option from  it, notably no
    NAMEFIND command.
 
4) Turn the "Keep of log of all transactions" option off.
 
5) Set the "Message-end character" OFF
 
6) Set the "Line-end character" OFF (if not using a modem)
 
7) Avoid using  a personalized  CHATDISC exec  -- just  erase it  and let
    Chat send the standard message to everybody.
 
8) Turn both "Translate:" options off, if at all possible...
 
 
In fact  the options that require  the most important amount  of CPU time
 are the 3278 to 3277 data  stream conversion (which cannot be turned off
 and is  required only for  3277-type terminal,  ie those not  capable of
 blinking)  and the  "Translate output  to uppercase"  option, but  it is
 impossible or not advisable to turn them off.
 
 
I/O speed considerations when used on  modem line: See the "Modem" option
 from the main menu.

The format of the Chat "&" command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
&            any-command-string
.BX OFF
.IN
 
Putting an  ampersand in the  first column of  the command line  before a
 Chat command  causes it to be  redisplayed in the command  line after it
 has  been executed.  This is  identical to  automatically issuing  a "?"
 command after the  command has been executed. The "&"  character must be
 entered immediately following the prompting arrow ("===> ").

The format of the Chat "?" command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
?            (operands are ignored)
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The Chat "?"  command will cause the last command  entered on the current
 screen to be  re-displayed in the command line. You  can then re-execute
 it by just  pressing ENTER. The "?" command must  be entered immediately
 after the prompting arrow ("===> ").
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) The cursor  will be placed at  the precise location where  it was left
    when the command  was executed, ie not necessarily at  the end of the
    command string. This was felt to be much more convenient when retrie-
    ving command  such as  "XEDIT FILEn  DATA", where  you would  like to
    modify "n" and not "DATA".
 
2) Chat keeps a different "last  command buffer" for each screen, thereby
    making the  6 screens independent  from each other. Although  this is
    in  most cases  much more  convenient  than a  "global" last  command
    buffer, it makes it impossible to  retrieve a command that was issued
    from a screen different than the currently displayed one.
 
3) Successive execution  of a  "?" command  will cause  Chat to  swap its
    "last command" and "previous-to-last  command" buffers, thereby allo-
    wing you to retrieve the previous-to-last command with two successive
    invocations of the "?" command. The previous-to-last command can also
    be retrieved with a single "??" command (qqv).

The Chat  "??" command  will cause  the previous-to-last  command entered

QUERY
 
The format of the Chat QUERY command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
Query        nickname
QELL         userid
             userid AT node
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The Chat  QUERY command will  query about another computer  user, telling
 you if he is currently logged on, disconnected, or not logged on at all.
 If the  person you are  querying about is on  the same computer  as you,
 you will  get the answer immediately  (see usage note 1).  Otherwise the
 command will be sent through the network to the appropriate computer and
 there will be a certain delay between your request and the reply.
 
A message saying  "LINK NOT ACTIVE", "LINK NOT CONNECTED",  "NO PATH TO",
 etc, means  that your request  could not be  processed due to  a problem
 with the  network lines --  just wait for a  few minutes and  try again.
 
A message  saying "userid - DSC"  means that the person  you are querying
 about is disconnected, while any  other message starting with "userid -"
 means  that the  person  is  connected to  the  computer and  (probably)
 available for chatting.
 
In either case,  the message will be  displayed on screen 0  (use the PF9
 key to switch to there).
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) Query  requests for  users not  in your  NAMES file  are treated  as a
    "CMS QUERY" command (see Chat  "CMS" command). It is therefore possi-
    ble to issue a CMS "QUERY" command from Chat without having to prefix
    it with "CMS". For instance, you  could issue a "Q DISK" command from
    Chat without having  to enter "CMS Q DISK", assuming  that you do not
    have any nickname called "DISK".
 
2) The "QELL" synonym for the Query command allows you to query about the
    person assigned to the currently displayed logical screen by pressing
    the  backward-field key  ("|<---" key  located  on the  right of  the
    second keyboard row -- the one ending with "uiop"), typing a "Q" over
    the "T" of "Tell Nickname " and pressing ENTER.
 
3) The "AT" keyword can be entered in mixed or upper case.
 
4) The "Query"  command supports  re-routing via  another node  (ie "SMSG
    RSCS  CMD routenode  CMD targetnode  CPQ  U targetid").  This can  be
    achieved either by specifying "via nodeid" when entering the nickname
    on the  nicknames screen or  by defining a  ":via" tag in  your NAMES
    file.
 
5) The "via SMSG" and "via SEND"  options of the "Tell" command (qqv) are
    not supported by "Query" and cause  a "CMD SMSG CMD..." command to be
    issued.
 
6) The CHATFILT program, as shipped with the Chat package, will automati-
    cally parse the  "userid - DSC" and "userid -  cuu" messages and dis-
    play  one of  the  following user-friendly  messages  to the  current
    screen:
 
      Nickname is not logged on.
      Nickname is disconnected.
      Nickname is logged on terminal number xxxxxxx.
 
   Note: 'userid at  node' will be substituted to 'nickname'  if the user
          could not be found in your NAMES file.

QUIT
 
The format of the Chat QUIT command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
QUIT         (operands are ignored)
.BX OFF

Invoking the QUIT command is identical  to pressing the PF12 key and will
 exit from the Chat program. This command was intended mainly as an emer-
 gency exit command for users who inadvertently entered Chat from a cheap
 terminal which doesn't emulate PFkeys,  making it impossible for them to
 press the PF12 key (see "PF-keys  simulation" option for more details on
 the subject).
 
It can also be placed on the console stack by an EXEC program to termina-
 te the Chat environment.

The Chat  TELL command is  similar to the  CMS TELL command,  causing the
 message to be sent to the specified computer user. The message text will
 the be printed on the  appropriate logical screen, using the appropriate
 header (see "Layout" selection from main menu).
 
Unlike its CMS counterpart, the Chat  TELL command allows you to communi-
 with any RSCS  machine on the network, local or  remote. For instance, a
 Chat "Tell Zurich cpq n" could be substituted to the usual "CP SMSG RSCS
 CMD CZHRZU1A CPQ  N" command, assuming that you have  defined a nickname
 of Zurich  for RSCS at CZHRZU1A  (note: this assumes that  the userid of
 the RSCS  virtual machine in  your node  is "RSCS"; modify  the nickname
 definition accordingly if not the case).
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) The current  version of Chat  does not  support lists of  persons. The
    supplied  nickname must  therefore be  the one  of a  single computer
    user. To send messages to a list of users, use the "CMS TELL" command
    (see information about  the Chat "CMS" command).
 
2) Your NAMES file  will not be sought unless the  specified nickname has
    not been dedicated a screen. This  will save a considerable amount of
    CPU time compared to repeated use of the CMS "TELL" command.
 
3) The "AT" keyword,  if present, must immediately follow  the userid (ie
    there must be only a single blank between userid and "AT"). Otherwise
    it will be ignored and considered  as being part of the message text.
    It is  therefore possible to  send a  message starting with  the word
    "at" to a user by typing  an additional blank before the message text
    (this blank will  be removed by RSCS if the  person you're talking to
    is a  remote user). The "at"  keyword can be entered  either in mixed
    or upper case.
 
4) Chat will  automatically place a "Tell  Nickname " command on  all the
    screens that  are dedicated to  a user  whenever the command  line is
    blanked  out. Any  Chat command  to be  entered on  the command  line
    should be  typed over the word  "Tell". For instance, if  you want to
    execute a "Disconn"  command, you must move the  cursor backwards and
    type "Disconn" over the word  "Tell" -- "Tell nickname Disconn" would
    just  send a  message  to  the specified  nickname.  It is  therefore
    recommended that  all Chat commands  be entered from screen  0 (where
    the command line is always left blanked) -- except for "Tell", "Drop"
    and "Dismiss" which should be entered from a normal screen.
 
5) The "Tell" command allows you to re-route your messages via a specific
    node if the "via nodeid" option was specified when entering the nick-
    name or if  a ":via" tag was  found in the appropriate  entry of your
    NAMES file.  See the  "Nicknames" selection from  main help  menu for
    more details on the subject.
 
6) If you specify  to re-route the message "via SMSG"  or "via SEND", the
    message will be sent to the target user with a "CP SMSG" or "CP SEND"
    command (respectively), ignoring the nodeid. In this case, the messa-
    ge text will be upcased before  being sent. Note that this option has
    precedence  over the  implicit use  of  "SMSG RSCS  CMD nodeid"  when
    applied to a RSCS virtual machine, ie  you can use "via SMSG" or "via
    SEND" even with the RSCS virtual machine.
 
7) Messages to local node users can be sent either:
 
    - Via a "CP MSG" command (default),
 
    - Via RSCS (if you specified that the message be re-routed "via RSCS"
       when assigning a  screen to the user on the  nicknames screen), or
 
    - Via a  "CP TO" command  (if you specified  that the message  be re-
       routed "via CPTO").  The CP "TO" command is a  nonstandard CP com-
       mand that  is available  at some  nodes and  will send  a one-line
       message to the indicated user. Please note that if this command is
       not available  at your node,  all messages  sent via Chat  will be
       lost (and the console buzzer will  be rung to indicate the error).
 
 
   Furthermore, the default option of using  the "CP MSG" command to send
    messages to  local node users  can be  overriden by defining  a dummy
    entry  in  your  NAMES  file with  nickname  =  any_value  (ignored),
    userid = '*', node  = your_node and a ":via" tag  of either "RSCS" or
    "CPTO" (as  required). Note that a  specific ":via" tag in  the NAMES
    file entry of the person you are speaking to, or a specific "via xxx"
    on the nicknames screen, will override this default option.
    Since this setting will be extracted from your NAMES file only during
    initialization  (for obvious  performance  considerations), you  will
    have to quit Chat and re-enter it to place the modification online if
    it was made from within Chat.

PICTURE
 
The format of the Chat PICTURE command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
PICTURE      filename  nickname
                       userid
                       userid AT node
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The Chat PICTURE command allows you to send a "picture" to another compu-
 ter user. The  contents of the file "filename PICTURE  *" will be dumped
 to  the specified  user, using  several "TELL"  commands. You  should be
 aware that  sending numerous pictures  across the network can  result in
 considerable network load  and can be very painful for  1200 bauds modem
 users. On the other hand, it can  be very useful to dump the contents of
 a short program or note to someone when the file transmission queues are
 discouraging....
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) Although a "PICTURE" command will  generate several "TELL" commands to
    send the file text to its intended target, nothing will be logged in
    the corresponding screen.  There will not be any  "To nickname: text"
    message.
 
2) A "PICTURE"  command will always cause  messages to be sent  via RSCS,
    even when  the destination user is  from the local node.  The reasons
    for this are obvious.
 
3) The "AT" keyword,  if present, must immediately follow  the userid (ie
    there must be only a single blank between userid and "AT"). Otherwise
    it will be ignored and considered  as being part of the message text.
    It is  therefore possible to  send a  message starting with  the word
    "at" to a user by typing  an additional blank before the message text
    (this blank will  be removed by RSCS if the  person you're talking to
    is a  remote user). The "at"  keyword can be entered  either in mixed
    or upper case.
 
4) The "Picture" command supports the  "via SEND" and "via SMSG" features
    of the  "Tell" command (qqv),  as well as  its ability to  "speak" to
    RSCS virtual  machines by automatically  issuing a "CMD  nodeid text"
    command when the target userid is  the same as the local RSCS userid.
    It will NOT,  however, upcase the message text before  sending it, as
    the "Tell" command does, in much the same way as a CP command entered
    from the keyboard  is translated to uppercase while  the same command
    is left in mixed case if executed from an EXEC program.

nn
.BX OFF

The Chat  "nn" commands, where  "nn" is  a number in  the 1 to  12 range,
 simulate the depression of a  PFkey: entering "nn" immediately after the
 prompting arrow  ("===> "),  or immediately after  the "Tell  Nickname "
 command  text, is  equivalent to  pressing  the PFnn  key. When  entered
 directly  after the  prompt arrow,  these commands  operate even  if the
 "PF-keys  simulation" option  is set  to "NO"  (see "Options"  selection
 from the  main help menu),  but this  option has to  be set to  "YES" if
 the "nn" command is to be  accepted when entered after a "Tell Nickname"
 command line.
 
 
Example:
 
===> 10
===> Tell Christina 10
 
 would both "press" the PF10 key,  switching you to the nicknames screen.
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) This command  was designed only  to allow Chat  to run on  those cheap
    terminals where there is no such thing as a PFkey. The default option
    is therefore not  to allow the "nn" commands after  a "Tell Nickname"
    command line.

When entered  from a screen which  has already been dedicated  to a user,
 the Chat DROP command will:
 
1) Clear the screen from which it was entered,
2) Clear the input area (ie the command line) from that screen,
3) Un-assign the screen as if you had switched to the nicknames screen
    and you had blanked out the corresponding field.
 
Unlike the  DISMISS command (qqv),  the DROP  command will not  erase the
 disk-logfile for the corresponding user.
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) Attempting a "DROP" command on screen 0 will result in the usual error
    tag being displayed ("*** Error ***").  Since screen 0 is not dedica-
    ted to any specific user, it cannot be "dropped".
 
2) The "DELL" synonym for the DROP  command allows you to drop the person
    assigned to the currently displayed  screen by pressing the backward-
    field key  ("|<---" key located on  the right of the  second keyboard
    row --  the one  ending with "uiop"),  typing a "D"  over the  "T" of
    "Tell Nickname " and pressing ENTER.

The DISMISS command is therefore a "stronger" version of the DROP command
 (qqv).

CMS
 
The format of the Chat CMS command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
CMS          command-text
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The CMS command  allows you to execute any CMS  command from within Chat.
 The command text will be printed to screen 0, and Chat will edit a ready
 message ("R; T=...") identical to the one provided by CMS and print it
 on screen 0 upon command completion.
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) Any CMS command can be called from Chat (not just CMS SUBSET commands)
    with the following exceptions:
 
     a) Chat  cannot be called  recursively, ie you cannot  issue another
         CHAT command from within Chat.
 
     b) Any command  causing the Chat program to be  removed from storage
         will  cause CMS  to  abend. This  includes  "NUCXDROP CHAT"  and
         "NUCXDROP *" commands.
 
     c)  Any command  causing termination  of the  IUCV connection  esta-
         blished by Chat will cause it to stop functionning. These inclu-
         de IUCVTRAP, WAKEUP release 5, etc.
 
2) The command will be executed as  per a REXX "Address CMS" command, not
    just "Address COMMAND", ie exactly as if it had been entered from CMS
    command mode.
 
3) Any command  entered from the  Chat environment and not  recognized as
    begin a  Chat command will  be passed  to CMS for  execution, thereby
    effecting  an  implicit-CMS  function  similar  to  XEDIT's  IMPCMSCP
    option. It  is therefore  useless to prefix  the command  with "CMS",
    unless the CMS  command to be executed is also  a valid Chat command.
 
4) While the CMS command is  executing, all incoming messages (and possi-
    bly all the  output from the command  if you run the "Trap  VM and CP
    output" option  -- see  "Options" selection from  main menu)  will be
    held to be displayed upon completion of the command. You should there
    fore avoid calling long CMS commands from Chat (eg XEDIT, NOTE, MAIL)
    since you would not notice messages sent to you until you got back to
    Chat. Furthermore,  if more than 255  messages are sent to  you while
    the CMS command  is executing, all messages in excess  of 255 will be
    displayed on your terminal and lost to the Chat program.
 
5) The settings  of the  MSG, WNG,  CPCONIO and  VMCONIO options  will be
    changed back  to their original value  upon return from CMS,  in case
    the  CMS program  you called  might  have clobbered  the settings  to
    suppress a "PUN FILE..." message  or suchlike. It is therefore impos-
    sible to  change the settings  of the CP/VMCONIO options  by issuing,
    for instance, a "SET CPCONIO OFF" command from Chat. Use the "Trap VM
    and CP output" option instead  (see "Options" selection from the main
    help menu).
 
6) An erase/write operation is performed  on the console after completion
    of the CMS command, except if  the command was recognized as being an
    unknown CP/CMS command, an invalid  SUBSET command, or if the command
    started with  "CP". For example,  "CP IND"  will not cause  an erase-
    write operation, but "IND" alone will.
 
7) (information  for system  programmers  developping applications  under
    Chat) Chat issues  an HNDINT CLEAR before calling CMS  to execute the
    command and  thereafter issues an  HNDINT SET (preceded by  the usual
    CONWAIT). The CMS command itself is called from an internal REXX pro-
    gram (resident within  the Chat module itself). The  Chat CMS command
    therefore conforms EXACTLY to the REXX "Address CMS" conventions. The
    screen will be erased and  re-written (using erase-write) upon return
    from CMS.

.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
DISConnect   <reply-message-text>
              Message has been recorded.
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The DISConnect command disconnects you from your terminal and places Chat
 in an  "answering-machine" state, in  which it will record  all incoming
 messages and (possibly)  reply with a message to  their originators. The
 standard reply message is:
 
   "* Disconnected -- reply-message-text",
 
 where reply-message-text  is the  text you  specified in  the DISConnect
 command, or  "Message has  been recorded."  if you  did not  specify any
 parameter.
 
 
When you reconnect to your account, you  will have to press ENTER once to
 get back to Chat (after having entered a CP "Begin" command as usual, if
 your account  runs with  the CP  "SET RUN OFF"  option). Chat  will have
 printed the  following messages on all  the screens where a  message was
 received during your "disconnection":
 
Disconnected at MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS
  (the various messages that were received on that screen)
  (...)
Reconnected at MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS -- nnn message(s) on this screen
 
 
The screens where  no message was received will be  left unchanged. Addi-
 tionally, all  incoming messages will be  logged on the "ALL  LOG" file,
 with a time stamp on columns 82-98, regardless of the "Keep a log of all
 transactions" option (see the "Options" selection from main help menu).
 
The optional  "CHATDISC" exec, which  is automatically called  whenever a
 message is  received in disconnected  mode, allows you to  customize the
 reply message, defining different replies  according to the message ori-
 ginator.  See the  "CHATDISC" selection  from  main help  menu for  more
 details on the subject.
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1) Chat will re-configure its internal  work area according to the device
    characteristics  of the  console when  reconnecting, so  there is  no
    problem  about disconnecting  from an  IBM-PC and  reconnecting on  a
    3279-3B, for example.
 
2) If the CHATDISC exec  cannot be found on any of  your disks, Chat will
    use  the default  "* Disconnected  -- reply-message-text"  message to
    reply  to the  originator. However,  the following  messages will  be
    ignored and will not be replied to:
 
    - Messages from yourself (this includes CP/VMCONIO text)
    - Messages from a RSCS virtual machine  (userid = rscs userid on YOUR
       node)
    - Messages starting with an asterisk
 
   If you  decide to create  a CHATDISC EXEC,  it should also  conform to
    these three rules  (but anyway you should read  the "CHATDISC" selec-
    tion from main menu before starting a CHATDISC exec).
 
3) Chat will use a "CP MSG" command to send the reply message to users of
    the local node, so that the message  gets replied even if RSCS is not
    available (or has crashed). The CHATDISC EXEC, if any, should conform
    to this rule unless you are sure that your RSCS will always be avail-
    able.
 
4) Chat will  automatically exit  from disconnecting answering  mode upon
    reconnection when the "Trap VM and CP output" option is activated. In
    this case it will not be necessary  to hit ENTER to get back to Chat.

The general format of the Chat special commands is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
^Cargs
.BX OFF
.IN
 
Where "C" is the command name (see below) and "args" are the arguments to
 the command, if  any. These commands are intended to  be issued from the
 CMS console stack only (ie the  Chat macro should &STACK the command for
 later execution by Chat), and do not  cause the data entered on the Chat
 command line  to be lost.  Note that there is  no blank between  the "^"
 sign, the command name and  the arguments. Any invalid "special command"
 will be ignored by Chat to avoid the possible loops which could occur if
 an error  message was  printed, causing  control to  be returned  to the
 macro issuing the illegal command, etc.
 
 
 
Here follows a brief description for  each of the recognized Chat special
 commands:
 
 
The "^n" screen-switch command
.BX 1 73
.IN 2
^n
.BX OFF
.IN
 
This command will cause Chat to  switch to screen number "n" after having
 preserved the command  line. The PFkey-simulation commands, "nn", should
 not be used for that purpose since  they would cause any data entered on
 the command line to be lost and  could switch to the wrong screen if the
 user had changed the PFkey assignation.
 
 
 
The "^*" message-echo command
.BX 1 73
.IN 2
^*Xmessage
.BX OFF
.IN
 
This  command will  cause the  specified message  text ("message")  to be
 printed to the current screen,  without any header being inserted before
 the actual  message text. This message  will not be logged  to disk. The
 first character of  the argument, "X", indicates whether  the message is
 to be hilighted or not: "H" indicates a red, hilighted message while any
 other value indicates a blue, unintensified message.
 
Note that a message  can be easily displayed on screen 0  by issuing a CP
 "MSG * message-text" command, which  will furthermore cause an "Incoming
 message on #0" tag to be displayed.

***********************************************************************
 
Several features  have been  added to  the Chat program  to make  its use
 possible (and  even comfortable) on modem-connected,  or otherwise slow,
 terminals. Here  is a description of  the steps that should  be taken to
 configure Chat for modem use:
 
 
(1) The main problem with Chat is that it scrolls the screen, which makes
     it necessary to rewrite the entire  screen whenever a new message is
     received. This problem  can be fixed by changing the  setting of the
     "Scrolling window"  option on  the nicknames screen.  The "scrolling
     window" is the number of lines that are scrolled out of the physical
     screen  when a  scroll operation  is performed;  the same  amount of
     blank lines are then made available  at the bottom of the screen and
     filled little by little, without need for a screen refresh. The ini-
     tial setting is 1, but it can be increased to 9 if required.
 
(2) Another problem  is to  minimize the number  of screen  switches. The
     "Automatic  screen-switch" option  from the  nicknames menu  must be
     set to  "NO" to suppress all  automatic screen-switching operations.
 
    Every possible effort  must be made to minimize the  number of manual
     screen-switches as  well. It is  strongly recommended that  the Chat
     message filtering exec, CHATFILT (qqv),  be altered to echo all RSCS
     messages (and possibly  all messages from similar  local servers) to
     the  current screen  (instead of  screen  0). Refer  to comments  in
     "CHATFILT EXEC", as well as to the CHATFILT selection from main menu
     for more details on the subject.
 
(3) In an attempt to reduce the number of I/O operations, it is recommen-
     ded that  you define  a logical  "Line-end character"  as well  as a
     "Message-end character" (from the corresponding options on the nick-
     name screen) and you use them whenever possible to send several com-
     mands in  a single  transmission. Chat's line-end  character feature
     is identical  to CP's TERM  LINEND feature  and provides a  means to
     send several "logical"  commands on the same  physical command line.
     The message-end character allows you  to enter more than one message
     in a single "Tell" command:  each message-end character will start a
     new message  (to the  same user). Refer  to the  "Options" selection
     from main help menu for more details on these commands.
 
(4) Since the nicknames-screen is quite "large" and requires much time to
     be transmitted through the modem,  you should try to avoid switching
     to it.  Un-assigning screens can be  achieved by means of  the (very
     fast) "Drop" command (qqv) without having to switch to the nicknames
     screen.
 
(5) Modem-connected terminals are usually  cheap models which lack lower-
     case characters, PFkeys, etc. Chat  is able to handle terminals with
     less than 80 physical columns, provided than a corresponding CP TERM
     LINESIZE command  has been  issued prior to  entering Chat.  In that
     case the "status area" (normally  located at the bottom right corner
     of the screen) will  be moved to the upper left  corner to make sure
     that it will appear on the display.
 
     (a) Lowercase  characters: if your terminal  cannot handle lowercase
          characters (eg  it displays  them as  semi-graphic characters),
          you should turn on the  "Translate: Output to uppercase" option
          on the  nicknames screen, as  well as the "Translate:  Input to
          lowercase" option (see below).
 
     (b) ALL  CAPS input: if your  terminal is able to  display lowercase
          characters without  providing them on  the keyboard, or  if for
          any other reason you are unable to enter your messages in lower
          case, you  should turn on  the "Translate: Input  to lowercase"
          option on the  nicknames screen. This will cause  your input to
          be  converted  to  lowercase,   with  capitals  being  inserted
          wherever required, ie  at the beginning of  the sentence, after
          punctuation  marks  (.?!) and  when  an  isolated "i"  appears.
 
          Example:
 
         THIS IS A SAMPLE SENTENCE. CHAT WILL MAKE IT NEATER, I'M SURE IT WILL!
 
    ---> This is a sample sentence. Chat will make it neater, I'm sure it will!
 
 
     (c) Lack of PF-keys: the  "PF-keys simulation" option from the nick-
          names  screen should  be activated.  You will  then be  able to
          simulate the depression of a  given PF-key by entering its num-
          ber on the command line  of any message-screen, either directly
          after the arrow or after a "Tell Nickname" command. Since there
          is no command line on the nicknames screen, it was decided that
          pressing ENTER  when the nicknames  screen is displayed  and no
          field has been  altered will cause Chat to switch  to screen 0,
          as if the PF9 key had been pressed.

Chat provides a  set of facilities for communication  with Relays, making
 the output  neater and saving  some disk  space when logging  the output
 to disk.
 
In order for these facilities to  be activated, you must change the nick-
 name(s) of your usual relay host(s)  to something starting with the word
 "RELAY"  (eg "RELAY",  "RELAYUTC", "RELAYHEC").  You will  then have  to
 assign a screen to  your relay, exactly as if it were  a normal user. If
 the userid of the relay you plan  to connect yourself to is "RELAY", you
 can activate  this facility without defining  a new entry in  your NAMES
 file by assigning  a screen to 'RELAY at host_relay_node'.  In that case
 a special 'Relay:n' nickname will  be temporarily assigned to the relay.
 
 
Chat will then automatically:
 
1) Suppress the "From Nickname: " header on that screen.
 
2) Suppress the "To   Nickname: " header on that screen and replace it
    with a relay header (see below)
 
3) Change any single leading dot (".") in an incoming message to a blank.
    Relays send leading dots when formatting a long message to paragraphs
    because RSCS would strip leading blanks from the message.
 
   Example:
 
      <Eric> This line is a normal one, but the
      .      continuation line will start with
      .      a dot so that RSCS doesn't strip the
      .      blanks.
 
   Chat will automatically remove all these trailing dots.
 
4) Suppress printing  of the  messages from  relay to  screen 0.  Since a
    considerable amount of messages is to  be expected from relay, it was
    deemed  unnecessary to  display them  on  screen 0  where they  would
    perpetually scroll the important messages out of the screen...
 
5) Parse the "/Signon"  and "/Nickname" commands and  alter the nicknames
    screen "R."  field accordingly  (see below). The  field will  be left
    unchanged if you do not specify any argument to the command.
 
6) Suppress  the possible  message-prefix  (from MSGNOH-endowed  relays).
    This prefix is  usually "Relay: ", but anything with  a ": " sequence
    within the first 8 characters of the message will be removed.
 
 
You must also fill in the  nicknames screen "R." field (located below the
 field corresponding to screen number 6) with your own relay-nickname, ie
 the one you have used on the "/SIGNON" command when signing on to relay,
 not your NAMES file nickname for the  userid at node of your host relay.
 
 
 
Relay  headers  for  outbound  messages: the  standard  "To   Nickname: "
 header is replaced with the following header when on a relay screen:
 
- No header at all  if the message text started with a  "/" or "&" (relay
   command prefix characters)
 
- No header at all if the nicknames screen "R." field has been left blank
 
- "<Your_relay_nickname> "  if the  nicknames field  "R." field  has been
   previously filled with the nickname  you are currently using on relay.

In this file you  will find information about the use of  Chat as a GONE-
 like  answering machine.  You can  skip the  next paragraph  if you  are
 already familiar with automatic answering programs.
 
 
What  is an  automatic answering  machine program?  Similar to  a mundane
 answerphone, it will  record messages sent during your  absence and send
 back an  acknowledgement to the sender,  saying where you are,  what you
 are doing  and when you  will be back.  A phone set  being intrinsically
 stupid and perfectly  tactless will leave a message saying  that you are
 at a party today and hope to have  fun there until 3 am; and if for some
 reason your  boss unexpectedly decides  to give you  a ring to  tell you
 that "Well, I know  I've asked you to finish that urgent  job as soon as
 you can, but I  really wouldn't want you to think I am  a tyrant or any-
 thing... Listen,  I've just watched 'Tosca'  at the TV and  I was struck
 by the physical resemblance between that  Scarpia and me, and that Tosca
 had the  very same  hair as you  and it kept  tormenting me  and... Hey,
 what's that message??? Where did you  say you were????", you can be sure
 your  answerphone  will  impassibly  and unerringly  deliver  the  fatal
 message....
 It being a  fairly well-known fact that computers are  much more complex
 than phone sets  (just ask your local telephone company  clerk if he can
 help  you find  out  what's going  wrong with  the  IBM 3090-400  you've
 just finished installing in your dining room), you would expect a compu-
 ter-programmed answering  machine to be  a little more  intelligent than
 that stupid answerphone  that now lays broken in the  middle of the yard
 after having  delayed your pay raise  by an undefinite but  probably not
 unsignificant period  of time... Indeed, Chat  will allow you to  set up
 different replies according to the person that "calls" you: one for your
 boss, saying "Good  night sir. I'm so  busy with that piece  of work you
 gave me yesterday that I decided to start my answering machine so as not
 to get disturbed by phone calls. Will do my utmost best to have finished
 that  job  tomorrow.",  another  one for  your  office  friends,  saying
 "Hiya! I'm at  Christina's party! Why don't ya join  us???"; another one
 for your boyfriend (the same but with some sweet nothings appended); and
 yet another  one for that !$+%*&!^!  Bob who keeps on  bothering you day
 and night, saying something that you  probably wouldn't want to see in a
 public help file like this one. But since computers are generally gifted
 with Artificial Imbecility  (AI), you would still have to  tell the pro-
 gram who is Bob, who is your  boyfriend, who is your boss, etc., so that
 it doesn't send  your boyfriend the message that  was initially intended
 for Bob, and vice-versa...  In fact you will have to  write a short pro-
 gram in a language that the computer is able to understand (don't panic,
 it's not THAT  difficult!), telling it who is to  receive which message,
 etc.
 
 
To start  the Chat built-in answering  machine program, you must  issue a
 "DISConnect" command from  the Chat environment. This  command accepts a
 message text as optional parameter, and causes Chat to wait for incoming
 messages, log them on disk and reply with a message. The standard messa-
 ge is:
 
      "* Disconnected -- your message has been recorded."
 
        if you did not specify  any argument to the "DISConnect" command,
    or:
 
      "* Disconnected -- message text",
 
        if you did specify a message text when issuing the "DISC" command
 
 
If you  just want Chat  to behave as  a mundane phone  answering machine,
 sending  the default  message back  to everybody,  you do  not need  the
 CHATDISC EXEC program  -- just erase it from your  disk and forget about
 it. In the following discussion we will assume that this is not the case
 and that you wish to set up Chat for "intelligent" message answering.
 
The "CHATDISC EXEC"  program, if present, will receive  control from Chat
 whenever a message is received while in answering machine mode (ie after
 you have issued  a Chat "DISC" command). The  sender's "userid" (account
 number) and "node" (host computer  identification), the text of the mes-
 sage he sent you and the text of the standard reply message (the one you
 specified when  you executed the "DISC  default-reply-message-text" com-
 mand) will be  passed to the program. CHATDISC will  then have to decide
 on an appropriate reply message, send it, and return control to the Chat
 program. An "Exit 0" instruction in  CHATDISC will tell Chat not to send
 any further  message to the sender,  while an "Exit 1"  instruction will
 cause Chat to send the standard reply back to the sender.
 
This simple convention makes it possible for CHATDISC to ignore a message
 (no reply at all)  or to send both a personalized  message and the stan-
 dard reply. For example, you may wish to ignore all messages from system
 servers such as DIRMAINT, which are totally unable to receive reply mes-
 sages, least  of all to  analyze them and decide  not to bother  you any
 more since  you are not there  to read the  message. Or you may  wish to
 send an  additional message to some  friends to whom you  have something
 particular to say, for example:
 
  * Disconnected -- Hi, Christina!! Will you be at the party tonight?
  * Disconnected -- gone for lunch, back in an hour or so.
 
The first message being issued by CHATDISC and the second being the stan-
 dard reply message (issued by Chat).
 
 
 
Important notes:
 
1) ANY reply  message issued by CHATDISC  must be prefixed with  an aste-
    risk. NO message starting with an asterisk should ever be replied to.
    This  will avoid  possible  "message wars"  between two  disconnected
    answering machines who would keep replying to each other...
 
2) Messages from yourself, or from a  RSCS machine, should not be replied
    to. When  functioning in "answerphone"  mode, Chat will not  reply to
    these  messages, and  it is  your  responsibility to  make sure  that
    CHATDISC does not reply to these messages.
 
3) If you  run with  the "Trap  VM and CP  output" option  activated, you
    should take  all appropriate steps  to make  sure that no  message is
    printed to the virtual console  when processing the incoming message.
    You should  notably make sure  that no  message is printed  when your
    disk becomes full, or then "remember" the condition (via GLOBALV) and
    never attempt any further disk  logging. Another solution would be to
    stack a  "QUIT" command  to terminate  Chat upon  receipt of  a "DISK
    FULL" message.
 
4) All the functions of the "GONE"  exec are not implemented in the stan-
    dard CHATDISC provided  with the Chat package, but there  would be no
    technical problem about adding them.
 
5) Chat optionally allows you to set  up your timer while disconnected in
    such a way that it will "eat" some CPU time at regular time intervals
    (every 10 minutes) to make sure  that your account doesn't get forced
    off by your system's resource limiter or similar -- assuming there is
    one. This  is realized by adding  a "CP SET TIMER  REAL" command into
    CHAT EXEC (before the call to the module, of course). Please not that
    it is your responsibility to make sure that your administration staff
    allows the use of disconnected anwering machines -- the author should
    in no way be considered responsible  for any problem that might arise
    due to use (and possible abuse) of the CHATDISC program.
 
6) More information  about the "DISConnect"  command can be found  in the
    appropriate helpfile from the "CHATCMD" help sub-menu.

***********************************************************************
 
The Chat message  filtering facility is a  user-tailorable REXX procedure
 ("CHATFILT EXEC") that  allows you to filter incoming  messages. It will
 receive control upon receipt of a message  from a user which has not yet
 been assigned a  screen, and will decide whether a  new screen should be
 automatically allocated  for this user  (default option) or not.  In the
 latter case, the  messages will either be printed on  screen 0 (and only
 there)  or completely  ignored, as  indicated by  the CHATFILT  program.
 Since the exec will NOT be called when the message originator has alrea-
 dy been dedicated  a screen, it will require only  a very limited amount
 of CPU time on the average, unless of course you keep receiving messages
 from someone you do not want to talk with and to whom you do not want to
 assign a screen. For the same reason,  the exec is not called to process
 CP/VMCONIO  output from  yourself (those  are automatically  directed to
 screen 0).
 
 
Possible  applications for  this filter  are: (the  lines marked  with an
 asterisk indicate  that the "standard"  CHATFILT EXEC - the  one shipped
 along with the Chat package - supports that particular function)
 
 
  (1) Cancel the automatic screen allocation process by causing all messa
       ges from new users  to be sent to screen 0.  You can then manually
       assign screens,  in the  order that you  choose, to  those persons
       with whom you want to speak.
 
  (2) Cancel the  automatic screen allocation  process and block  out all
       messages from new users. A message is sent back to the originator,
       saying that you are busy and cannot receive any message right now,
       and the message  is ignored (and possibly logged to  disk, at your
       option). You can still converse with  up to six people by manually
       assigning a screen to them -- in that case their messages will not
       get blocked.  You can drop  them whenever desired by  just de-assi
       gning the screen. You can also define a list of users whose messa-
       ges  must  never  be  ignored  (eg  your  boss  or  husband/wife).
 
* (3) Cause all messages from file  servers and/or system accounts to get
       printed to screen 0 instead of being dedicated a screen. Suggested
       userids to be trapped to  screen 0 are: MAILER, LISTSERV, NETSERV,
       DIRMAINT, CMSBATCH. Please note that messages from RSCS are always
       confined to screen 0.
 
* (4) Cause  all messages  starting with  an  asterisk to  be trapped  to
       screen 0.
 
* (5) Suppress all  "FILE (nnnn)  ENQUEUED ON  LINK xxxx"  messages (from
       RSCS). Since an  error message is sent when the  file is rejected,
       you need  not have  any qualms about  discarding this  useless and
       boring message.
 
 
* (6) Parse the "SENT FILE..." messages and neaten then up. Example:
 
       File 1234 has been sent across the Geneva to Roma line to Bob
       File 1234 has been sent across the Roma to Israel line to Bob
       File 1234 has reached Bob
 
 
* (7) Parse the "FILE SPOOLED TO userid -- ORG..." messages from RSCS,
       scan your reader for the file and display a message to current
       screen, such as:
 
       File "CHAT MODULE" (2345) from Eric has been placed in your reader
 
 
* (8) Parse the "CPQ:..." messages, search your names file for the corres
       ponding nickname and display a nice message, such as:
 
       Rosanne is disconnected.
       Christian is not logged on.
       Sylvia is logged on terminal number 56C.
 
 
  (9) Display all RSCS  messages to current screen rather  than screen 0.
       This is particularly useful for modem users since it will save you
       a screen  switch operation.  The code for  this function  has been
       provided in  the "standard" CHATFILT  EXEC in "comments"  form and
       can be easily made operational.
 
 
*(10) Parse the "LINK xxx INACTIVE", "LINK xxx NOT CONNECTED" and "PATH
       LOST TO xxx" messages, search your NAMES file for the correspon-
       ding nicknames and display a message such as:
 
       Link failure on the Geneva to Roma path
       Link failure on the Roma to BITNIC path
 
   Please refer to the comments  in "CHATFILT EXEC" for more information.
It is strongly recommended that unexperienced REXX programmers do not try
to add new  functions to the standard exec since  any REXX interpretation
error might cause the console to  hang and might require a "cold" startup
of your virtual machine (log off and  log on again) to clear the problem.
The cause of this little annoyance lays in the fact that Chat cannot give
the control of the terminal back to CMS while CHATFILT is being called --
refer to the comments in CHATFILT EXEC for more details on this topic.

Chat NAMES command (CHATNAME)
 
The format of the CMS CHATNAME command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
CHATNAME     <nickname <userid <nodeid <full_name>>>>
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The CMS CHATNAME command is identical  to the standard IBM NAMES command,
 with the following differences:
 
1) Not only the  nickname, but the userid, nodeid  and person's full-name
    can be  specified on the command  line, making it much  easier to add
    new nicknames. This is particularly  convenient when someone sent you
    a message and you want to add a  nickname for him: you do not have to
    write his userid and node on a scrap of paper before calling NAMES as
    was the case with the standard IBM command.
 
2) The length of  the nickname field has been expanded  to 14 characters,
    the maximum length accepted by Chat.
 
3) The nickname  is trimmed to mixed  case according to the  Chat conven-
    tions (see "Nicknames" selection from main help menu for more details
    on the subject).
 
4) The console "insert mode" key can be used freely under CHATNAME, which
    was not the case under the standard NAMES (you had to move to the end
    of the text and press the ERASE  EOF key before being able to use the
    insert mode key).
 
5) The screen layout has been slightly altered to make sure that CHATNAME
    is not mismatched for the standard NAMES exec.
 
6) A "Charlot  RELOAD" command is  issued upon  exit from the  program to
    reload the  NAMES file into  storage, when using the  Charlot message
    filtering program.  This will  only affect the  users of  the Charlot
    program.
 
 
The CHATNAME  program is an  optional component  of the Chat  package and
 requires the following files:
 
   CHATNAME EXEC      (maybe renamed to NAMES EXEC on your system)
   CHATNAME XEDIT
   CHATXNAM MODULE
 
If these files are  not present on any of your disks,  you may order them

Chat RDRLIST command (CHATRL)
 
The format of the CMS CHATRL command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
CHATRL       (no argument is accepted)
.BX OFF
.IN
 
The CMS  CHATRL command is similar  to the standard IBM  RDRLIST command,
 with the following exceptions:
 
1) The file  sender's nickname,  if any, is  substituted to  the standard
    "userid node" indication, making the  list much easier to read. Nick-
     names with a blank ":node" entry are supported.
 
2) Mails sent via  a MIT mailer are displayed with  the sender's nickname
    or  "userid node"  indication instead  of the  mailer machine's  one,
    provided that the mailer's userid is "MAILER".
 
3) The nickname  is trimmed to mixed  case according to the  Chat conven-
    tions (see "Nicknames" selection from main help menu for more details
    on the subject).
 
4) An assembly language reader queue processor is used to minimize execu-
    tion time  when building the list.  This new processor can  handle an
    unlimited number of  reader files, unlike the  standard RDRLIST which
    cannot cope with more than 110  files (which could cause notes not to
    be received in  chronological order, even though  the supplied reader
    list had been sorted by date).
 
5) Messages are  passed to  the XEDIT  environment if it  is found  to be
    active. For example, issuing a CHATRL command against an empty reader
    while under  XEDIT would  display "No  file in  your reader."  in the
    XEDIT message area  instead of clearing the XEDIT  screen and forcing
    you to press the CLEAR or PA2 key thereafter.
 
6) The MSGSERV  program is  automatically activated, if  present. MSGSERV
    is a program  written by Martin Scheffler (also  known as "MegaByte")
    to direct all incoming messages and CP/CMS output to the XEDIT messa-
    ge area. Contact Martin Scheffler  (I7090202 at DBSTU1) for distribu-
    tion.
 
7) For performance considerations it has  been decided that the file ori-
    gin field  ("userid node" or  "<Nickname>") would not  be re-computed
    each time you execute a  prefix command from Chat-RDRLIST. This means
    that if  you execute  a prefix command  that dynamically  changes the
    file TAG, the userid/node/nickname indication on the reader list will
    not  be updated  until you  depress  the Refresh  PF-key (PF2).  This
    little restriction will,  however, save a considerable  amount of CPU
    time, especially if you have a large NAMES file.
 
 
The  CHATRL program  is an  optional component  of the  Chat package  and
 requires the following files:
 
   CHATRL   EXEC    (maybe renamed to RDRLIST or RL EXEC on your system)
   CHATXEQ  XEDIT
   CHATRDRL MODULE
 
If these files are  not present on any of your disks,  you may order them
 from ERIC at FRECP11 (Eric Thomas).

Special note about  file servers: any official (ie  not clandestine) file
 server is allowed to distribute the  Chat package, provided that it com-
 plies to the following rules:
 
  1) The name of the programs must  not be changed without express autho-
      rization from the author.
 
  2) The file server owners must accept  to make new versions of the pro-
      gram available on the server  within a reasonable delay. The reason
      for this restriction  is that any severe "bug" in  the program will
      usually cause  about fifty complaining notes  a week to be  sent to
      the author's  reader. That traffic must  be stopped as soon  as the
      problem is corrected, for obvious  reasons (both technical and psy-
      chological...)
 
  3) The author is notified of the installation of the program so that he
      can send new versions of the program to the server's owner.
 
 
 
The following  files must be  made available on  the public disk  or file
 server:
 
    CHAT     MODULE
    CHAT     EXEC    (Chat package)
 
    CHATXEQ  XEDIT
    CHATRDRL MODULE  (Chat-RDRLIST package)
 
    CHATNAME XEDIT
    CHATXNAM MODULE  (Chat-NAMES package)
 
None of these programs should ever be renamed.
The users should be asked not to copy them to their own minidisks and not
 to alter them in  any way. Failure to observe this  rule could result in
 mild to severe  damage to the user's virtual core  and/or minidisks, for
 which the author could not  be held responsible. Only experienced system
 programmers should make changes to these programs.
 
 
 
 
The following programs must be  made available under the same conditions,
 but they can be renamed if desired:
 
    CHATRL   EXEC   (Chat-RDRLIST package) suggested name: "RL", "CRL"
    CHATNAME EXEC   (Chat-NAMES   package) suggested name: "CNAME", "CN"
 
It is of course possible to  rename them to "RDRLIST" and "NAMES" respec-
 tively to override  the default IBM execs, but this  is not recommended.
 An  alternative solution  would  be  to install  them  as "RDRLIST"  and
 "NAMES" on a public disk devoted to network files, while the versions on
 the system disks  are left unchanged. Users should NOT  copy those files
 to their own disks, even if they want to have them with another name. In
 that case they  should define synonyms for the execs  on the system disk
 to be sure that they always use the latest version.
 
 
 
The following files must be made  available on the public disk or server:
 
    CHATDISC EXEC
    CHATFILT EXEC   (Chat package)
 
They must not be renamed. The users are, however, encouraged to copy them
 to their own minidisk and to alter  them to suit their needs; changes to
 these execs  will be signaled  in the  CHATnn CHATMEMO files  which will
 have to be made available to the users (see below), so that they can ma-
 ke the change in their own personalised copy.
 
 
 
CHATnn CHATMEMO files: these files  contain a detailed description of all
 the changes that took place in Chat  from one release to the other. They
 should be made available to all the  Chat users, which should be told to
 have a  look at them  from time to  time. A new/revised  CHATnn CHATMEMO
 will be sent  along with each update  to the Chat program  and should be
 inspected by the local  Chat contact to check that there  is no new pro-
 blem with  the (possible) local  modifications to the system  before the
 new  version is  placed  on the  system  disk (this  does  not apply  to
 servers). Only the two lastest CHATMEMOs need to be kept -- as a rule of
 thumb, any  such memos that has  been removed from Netserv  is no longer
 required and can be discarded. It is strongly suggested that a notice be
 added into the local "user newsletter" system, if any, to tell the users
 about the newly obtained version of the program.
 
 
 
Help files:  file servers will only  need to keep the  CHAT HELPCMS file.
 This file is  a concatenation of several helpfiles,  including two help-
 menus. The  scattered HELPCHAT files  can be extracted from  the HELPCMS
 file by  means of a special  exec, CHATHELP, available from  the author.
 The  HELPCHAT/HELPMENU system  will be  used by  Chat if  available, but
 for technical  reasons the  bare HELPCMS file  takes precedence  over it
 (otherwise a HELPMENU  file on the help-disk would not  be detected by a
 STATE command unless it has been preivously accessed). It is recommended
 that the Chat help information be kept in HELPCHAT/HELPMENU form if Chat
 is installed on a public disk, in  which case CHATHELP must be run every
 time  a new  HELPCMS file  is obtained  to automatically  regenerate the
 scattered HELPCHAT files. It is recommended, but not mandatory, that the
 files be placed on the help disk (usually MAINT 19D). In any case, it is
 MANDATORY that the  old CHAT HELPCMS file be erased,  otherwise it would
 be displayed and the HELPMENU file would just be ignored.
 
 
Obtaining the files:  the Chat package 'per se' can  be obtained from the
 nearest  Netserv  server, which  will  always  have the  latest  version
 (unless a link has been down for  a long time). Those among you who have
 Netserv privileges can even set  up an Automatic File Distribution (AFD)
 request for the Chat files  (see "NETSERV HELPFILE" for more information
 on AFD). Other  users can contact the  author to be added  onto the Chat
 distribution list, in which case  they will automatically receive a note
 from  the Chat  distribution account  (CHAT at  FRECP11) whenever  a new
 version of the  program has been made available on  the Netserv servers.
 The Chat-RDRLIST and Chat-NAMES packages cannot be obtained from Netserv
 but are automatically distributed by the Chat distribution account. Con-
 tact the author (Eric Thomas <ERIC@FRECP11>)  if you wish to be added to
 the Chat distribution list.
 
 
Help files  in other  languages: although it  is obviously  impossible to
 provide all the Chat helpfiles in several languages, it would be interes
 ting to have "general introduction" helpfiles in other languages for the
 potential  Chat users  which are  not familiar  with english.  Some Chat
 users  have translated  some of  the english  helpfiles (or  written new
 ones) in their  own tongue, and have accepted to  make them available to
 everybody.
 
- Prof.Dr. P.L. Reichertz   <PL_REI@DHVMHH1>
  (from Medizinisches Hochschulrechenzentrum Hannover, Germany)
 
   has written a set of two helpfiles in German:
 
      CHATEIN  HELPCMS  -- Allgemeine und kurze Einf}hrung in das CHAT
      CHATINST HELPCMS  -- Allgemeine implementierungshinweise
 
   They are available from Netserv as GERMAN CHATMEMO.
 
 
- Luis Miguel Fernandez Candocia <EARNAD@EMDUCM11>
  (from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain)
 
   has translated, in collaboration with  other people of his University,
   the  complete set  of Chat  helpfiles  into Spanish.  These files  are
   available as SPANISH CHATMEMO.
 
 
 
If you have written or translated helpfiles for Chat in your own language
 and you are willing to make  them available to users from other systems,
 just contact me (Eric Thomas <ERIC@FRECP11>)  and I will mention them in
 this helpfile. I will try to  make them available on Netserv (as "GERMAN
 CHATMEMO",  "SPANISH CHATMEMO",  etc),  provided that  they are  general
 enough (ie  a file explaining  from which system  disk the files  can be
 obtained at this or that node is not suitable).
 
.CM File: CHATRDRL HELPCHAT A1 (07/08/86 12:14:07)

Technical information about the CHATRDRL assembler reader-queue processor
 
This information is designed for EXEC/REXX programmers who develop appli-
 cations using the CHATRDRL module as a sub-program. This is not the help
 information file for the Chat-RDRLIST command (CHATRL).
 
 
The format of the CHATRDRL command is:
 
.BX 1 14 73
.IN 2
CHATRDRL     userid node RSCS-userid MAILER-userid  <options>
 
 
             Available options are:
 
               NONAMES
               REALRDR
               REALPUN
               REALPRT
               ALLFILES
.BX OFF
.IN
 
CHATRDRL is a reader-queue assembler  processor which was primarily desi-
 gned to support  the Chat-RDRLIST command. It will scan  the contents of
 your reader and stack an information line for each file (in RDRLIST for-
 mat). Unlike EXECIO, CHATRDRL is not limited by the 8k-reply-buffer-size
 "feature" and can handle any number of spool files. It will, additional-
 ly, substitute the file sender's nickname  (from your NAMES file) to his
 userid/node, whenever applicable. Note that  the NAMES file is read into
 storage at initialization using  the considerably fast block-read method
 (ADMSBLKR), then pre-processed and converted into a smaller fixed format
 table which is  then scanned via BXLE whenever required  -- it is really
 as fast as it CAN be.
 
 
Available options:
 
NONAMES   indicates that  the NAMES file  must not be used  for searching
          nicknames.  Note that  this option  will considerably  speed up
          CHATRDRL,  especially if  your  NAMES file  is large:  CHATRDRL
          spends about two-thirds of its time  to read in the NAMES file,
          format it and scan the table...
 
REALRDR   indicates that the  real system reader must  be processed. This
          option is restricted to privileged  (class E) users. It implies
          the NONAMES option, and yields a slightly different output (see
          below).
 
REALPUN   is identical to  REALRDR except that the system  punch chain is
          scanned.
 
REALPRT   is identical to  REALRDR except that the system  print chain is
          scanned.
 
ALLFILES  is applicable only when one of the REALxxx option is specified;
          it indicates  that normally unseen  files, such as  files being
          processed by  system (ie  being printed, being  SPTAPEd), files
          currently open for  reading, must be included in  the list too.
          These files  will be identified by  an asterisk in column  1 of
          the RDRLIST-line, and cannot be CP TRANSFERred, CP PURGEd, etc.
          However, some  applications (such as counting  the total number
          of lines in the system spool) might require information on the-
          se files. Note  that files which have not yet  been enqueued on
          the reader chain, such as files which have not yet been closed,
          started console,  will not  be listed. The  only way  to obtain
          them is  to scan the VSPLCTL  block of every URO  VDEVBLOK, for
          every user in the system -- a CPU consuming task indeed...
 
Options  must be  entered immediately  after the  last mandatory  keyword
 (MAILER-userid), without any parenthesis.
 
 
Notes on real reader-chain processing:
 
1) When one of the REALxxx options is specified, the first four arguments
   become irrelevant  since the TAG data  is not inspected and  the NAMES
   file is ignored.  They can be conveniently  replaced by place-holders,
   eg "CHATRDRL . .  . . REALRDR". Note that the  TAG information is kept
   on  disk by  CP and  is therefore  not easily  accessible, to  say the
   least...
 
2) Real-reader scanning  in a  time-sharing environment  is intrinsically
   tricky since another user can be  dispatched at any time and can PURGE
   the very  file you were  processing, causing  the pointer to  the next
   file in  chain to become  invalid... Whenever CHATRDRL detects  such a
   condition, it will immediately return to the caller with a return code
   of 2. It  will probably have stacked some lines  already, and the last
   one will  probably be  garbage; therefore  the calling  program should
   clear everything  that might  have been stacked  by CHATRDRL  (using a
   DESBUF/DROPBUF command  as applicable)  and re-issue the  command. The
   condition should not persist, unless  (perhaps) a SPTAPE DUMP with the
   PURGE option is in progress. It is therefore suggested that the follo-
   wing algorithm be used to invoke CHATRDRL:
 
     Do 10     /* 10 retries should suffice */
       'MAKEBUF'
       'CHATRDRL . . . . REALRDR'
        If rc ^= 2 Then Leave
       'DROPBUF'
     End
     If rc = 2 Then Call Sorry_couldn't_manage_to_have_CHATRDRL_function
 
3) You should also be aware of the  fact that, for the same reason, it is
   possible for CHATRDRL  to "miss" some reader files if  a CP ORDER com-
   mand is issued just at the wrong instant. This condition is impossible
   to detect  (although in certain cases  it CAN be detected,  eg when it
   causes files to be listed twice) and is VERY unlikely to occur.
 
4) The output  produced by  CHATRDRL when scanning  real spool  chains is
   slightly different  (see detailed description below)  and includes the
   (real) SFBLOCK  address associated with  the file, making  it possible
   for the calling program to obtain  any information about the file that
   CHATRDRL did not provide, eg DISTcode.  Note that since the file might
   have  "disappeared"  at the  time  the  calling program  examines  the
   SFBLOCK,  yielding irrelevant  information, it  is strongly  suggested
   that the spoolid be retrieved from  the SFBLOCK along with the desired
   information (on  the same DCP  command) and compared with  the spoolid
   returned by CHATRDRL; if they do not match, the file should be ignored
   (it has just been purged). Note that the spoolid might still be intact
   in real storage while the file has been purged (eg if the storage used
   by  the SFBLOCK  was not  yet recycled);  but in  that case  the WHOLE
   SFBLOCK will probably have been left intact and the information obtai-
   ned from it would be correct, although no longer useful.
