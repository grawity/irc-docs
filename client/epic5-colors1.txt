About Control-C colors

If your client was compiled with #define CONTROL_C_COLORS and you have
/SET CONTROL_C_COLORS ON, then you can use the control-c colors feature.
The general syntax is:

color-seq-start := "^C" [number] ["," number]
color-seq-end   := "^C"

The first "number" is a positive integer at least 0 and not more than 15.
The colors correspond to the ANSI color schema:

	0 - black 	1 - red		2 - green	3 - yellow
	4 - blue	5 - magenta	6 - cyan	7 - white

The colors 8 through 15 are the corresponding "bold" versions of the colors
above, whatever that may be for your terminal.

The "standard" as imposed by mIRC forbids an empty leading value.  This
implementation choses not to impose this draconian restriction.  So there.

If you wish to defeat the color codes, you can have them filtered out by
doing /SET CONTROL_C_COLORS OFF.


OUR REVISIONS TO THE "STANDARD":

The syntax of colors has been modified to:

color-seq-start := "\003" + color-term + ["," color-term]
color-term      := ["0" + ["0..9"] | "1" + ["0..5"] ] | ["2..9"] | [""]
color-seq-end   := "\003"

Specifically, this implementation guarantees that at least zero and at most
two character will ever be used to construct the color code.  If the first
character is a 0, then the second character will be used if it is a number.
If the first character is a 1, then the second character will be used only if
it is a number at least 0 and at most 5.  A comma following the first color
term will only be "eaten" if it is followed by another valid term.

Either the first term or the second term may be empty.  If either term (but
not both) are ommitted, then no change will occur for that modifier.  If both
terms are omitted, the comma must also be omitted, and all color attributes 
will be terminated.

It is hoped that this clarification will allow the deterministic use of color
codes (if you always use two digit codes, then you will never have a problem
with the color codes munching too many characters.)
