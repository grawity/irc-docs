<H2>5. DCC Requests</H2>

[...explain DCC...]

<H3>5.1 DCC Over Firewalls</H3>

<P>
When CTCP and DCC were originally designed, firewalls were relatively
uncommon.  However, in recent years, firewalls (and other security measures)
have become increasingly commonplace, so it is prudent to define a protocol
that will allow a client to initiate a DCC request from behind a firewall.
For this purpose, we assume that "behind a firewall" means that the client
may not accept incoming connections from the internet, but may make outgoing
connections (either directly, or via socks or some other firewall protocol).
The requirement that a client be able to make outgoing connections is safe,
since a client would need to be able to do this in order to connect to an
IRC server in the first place.

<P>
A firewall DCC request has special values for the IP and port fields.

<H3>5.2 DCC CHAT</H3>

<P>
Request: "DCC" SP "CHAT" SP unused SP ip SP port
CHAT is used to initiate a conversation directly between clients. 
Often used to bypass the IRC network, and its associated latencies in
delivering messages.  It may also be used for other unspecified 
purposes.

<P>
The unused parameter is historical.  It should be set to "chat" in
requests, but some clients put effectively random strings here, so
don't count on any meaningful data in this field.
All messages recieved via the DCC CHAT connection should be treated 
in the same fashion as messages received from the IRC network via a
PRIVMSG.  This extention of the current protocol allows further 
requests or text attributes to be exchanged once the connection is
established.

<P>
If the recipient of the offer does not accept within a given time 
frame (5 minutes seems appropriate), or the recipient declines to 
enter a chat with the initiator, a negative acknowledgement should be 
sent, subject to flood control.  The format of this rejection should 
be a CTCP reply message of:

"ERRMSG" SP "DCC" SP "CHAT" SP unused SP "declined"
Upon reciept of this message, the initiator should inform its user 
and clear the offered connection.
Should the cause of the failure be for a reason other than timeout or 
user rejection, the rejection message should be a CTCP reply message,
taking the following format:
"ERRMSG" SP "DCC" SP "CHAT" SP unused SP error-message
CTCP messages and format codes may be sent over a DCC CHAT connection.
A CTCP reply via DCC CHAT is distinguished from a request by preceding
the keyword with a forward slash ("/").  For example, a CTCP PING request
would have a keyword of "PING", while the reply would have a keyword of
"/PING".  A DCC CHAT connection is a separate CTCP domain from IRC: all
requests sent over DCC CHAT must be answered via that DCC CHAT connection
(not via an IRC connection).

<H3>5.3 MIME DCC Protocol</H3>

<P>
Request: "DCC" SP mime-type SP filename SP ip SP port [SP size]
MIME transfers over DCC are intended to act as a replacement and
enhancement of the original DCC SEND protocol.  One of the main failings
of the older file exchange is that it required an acknowledgement of
receipt of data prior to more data being sent.  This is a direct
duplication of TCP streams, and as such is redundant.  DCC SEND also
lacks the capacity to restart a failed transmission from any other
point than the beginning of the file, and could not be used to send
a file to an IRC channel.

<P>
A MIME type can be differentiated from other DCC types by the presense
of a "/" (forward slash) in the DCC type.  That is, a DCC of type
"image/gif" is a MIME transfer, while a DCC of type "CHAT" is not.
The size field is optional.  The recipient client should provide
adequate means to create a local file from the offered data stream.
Alternatively the stream may be directed to another program for handling.
The filename should be presented without path information.  However,
path separators (for example, "/" on a Unix system) differ between
operating systems, so an IRC client should be prepared to accept a
filename that contains characters which may be invalid under that
client's operating system.  It is the client's perogative to convert
the filename into a locally acceptable form, or to prompt the user to
do so.

<P>
If the stream has no specific filename, the filename must be specified
as "-" (a single dash).  A file which has the filename "-" on a local
system must be renamed in transit to avoid confusion with this placeholder.
         
<P>
If the recipient of the offer does not accept within a given time 
frame (5 minutes seems appropriate), or the recipient declines to 
accept the offer from the initiator, a negative acknowledgement 
should be sent, subject to flood control.  The format of this 
rejection should be:

<P>
"ERRMSG" SP "DCC" SP mime-type SP filename SP "declined"
Upon reciept of this message, the initiator should inform its user 
and clear the offered connection.

<P>
Should the cause of the failure be for a reason other than timeout or 
user rejection, the rejection message should take the following 
format:

<P>
"ERRMSG" SP "DCC" SP mime-type SP filename SP user-text
The destination for a MIME DCC request may be a single IRC user or an
entire channel.  If the request is sent to an entire channel, this is
referred to as a "channel DCC", and the client must behave a little
differently.

<P>
For a channel DCC, the initiator should be prepared to accept more
than one connection to its listening port.  Each connection, once
established, must be treated as if it were a separate DCC request.
The listening port may be closed at any time by the initiating client
(usually after a reasonable timeout), but this must not affect any
previously established DCC connections.

<P>
MIME transfers over DCC have two stages after the connection is
established: a negotiation phase, and a data transmit phase.

<P>

<H3>5.3.1 MIME DCC Negotiation</H3>

<P>
Immediately upon connection to a MIME DCC request, the two sides begin
making option queries to each other.  Option queries are a method of
negotiating optional features in a MIME DCC transfer, such as resuming
a disconnected transfer, or encrypting the transfer.  Future improvements
or enhancements will probably appear as new option queries.

<P>
Each option query follows this format (loosely based on the telnet command
protocol, RFC854):

<PRE>
OPTION-QUERY	= QUERY OPTION PARAM-LEN PARAM-LEN(octet)
QUERY		= DO | DON'T | WILL | WON'T | END
END		= &lt;octet 255 (octal 0377)&gt;
DON'T		= &lt;octet 254 (octal 0376)&gt;
DO		= &lt;octet 253 (octal 0375)&gt;
WON'T		= &lt;octet 252 (octal 0374)&gt;
WILL		= &lt;octet 251 (octal 0373)&gt;
OPTION		= octet
PARAM-LEN	= octet
</PRE>

<P>
The PARAM-LEN specifies how many octets of parameters follow (0 indicates
no parameters).  This is to allow a client to detect the end of an option
that it doesn't understand.  Therefore an option may be a total of from
4 to 259 bytes in length, depending on the length of the parameters.
A client sends a query of "END" to indicate that it is done sending option
queries, and will send no more queries.  OPTION and PARAM-LEN must both be
zero (0) for and "END" query, and there is no response.  The meanings of
the other queries (DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T) are dependent on the option,
but have general meanings as follows.

<P>
A client sends "DO" to indicate that it would like the other client to use
an option.  The other client may respond "WILL" if it intends to comply,
or "WON'T" if it will not or can not comply.  A client that does not
understand the option must always reply "WON'T" to a "DO" option query.

<P>
A client sends "WILL" to indiciate that it would like to use an option.
The other client may respond "DO" if it agrees that the client should use
that option, or "DON'T" if it does not want the client to use the option.
A client that does not understand the option must always reply "DON'T" to
a "WILL" query.

<P>
Typically, each client should transmit all of its option queries in one
burst, followed by an "END" query.  Upon receiving each query, the client
must respond appropriately -- for every request, there must be a response.
Once each side has received an "END" query, and has received answers to
each of its queries, the option query phase is over, and the data transfer
begins.

<P>
Here is a diagram showing a typical option query negotiation.

<PRE>
   FILE SERVER				FILE CLIENT
   -----------				-----------
   transmit 4-byte timestamp
		----- 33 9D F3 29 ----&gt;
					(check the timestamp)
					transmit 4-byte requested offset
                &lt;---- 00 00 00 00 -----
   transmit a query (4 bytes): "WILL option #0" (4 parameters)
   option 0 is RESUME (see Appendix C)
                --- FB 00 04 33 CD 53 16 ---&gt;
   transmit a query (5 bytes): "WILL option #F0" (1 parameter: 5F)
   option F0 is a fake for the purpose of example
                --- FB F0 01 5F ------------&gt;
   transmit end of queries
                --- FF 00 00 ---------------&gt;
                                        transmit end of queries
                                        (the client has no option queries)
                &lt;--------------- FF 00 00 ---
                                        respond to option #0 query: DO
					resume at offset 1024
                &lt;--- FD 00 04 00 00 04 00 ---
                                        respond to option #F0 query: DON'T
                &lt;--------------- FE F0 00 ---
   data transfer begins...
</PRE>

<P>
In this diagram, the file client elected to start receiving at offset 1024,
indicating that this is probably a file resume.  The file server made
two option queries.  It offered to do option #0 (resume), which the file
client accepted.  It also asked to use option #F0 (with a parameter of 5F,
or 95 decimal), which the file client rejected.  The file client made no
option queries.

<P>
A list of currently-defined option queries is in Appendix C.

<P>

<H3>5.3.2 MIME DCC Data Transfer</H3>

<P>
After the negotiation is completed, the file server begins transmitting
data to the file client.  This data channel is considered 8-bit clean --
there is no quoting necessary on the contents.  The transfer is completed
when the connection terminates.  If a file length was specified in the
DCC XMIT request, either side may terminate the connection once the
specified number of bytes have been transferred.

<P>
Some MIME transfers may involve two-way protocols.  For the purposes of
the IRC client, once the option negotiation is complete, the DCC connection
should be treated as a two-way TCP pipe (possibly encrypted).  If the
connection is being directed to an external program, the data pipe must
be bi-directional.
