<h1> <font color=blue> CTCP/2 </font> - IRC client to client protocol</h1>
This page contains information and links about CTCP/2, a protocol being
crafted for IRC clients.  It updates the rapidly aging CTCP specification,
formalizes some features are current de-facto standards, and adds some
interesting new things.
<p>
The best way to find out about CTCP/2 is to read our draft.  The draft is
still being changed and discussed, so the documents here may change often.
<p>

    <br><em>(reasonably up-to-date; based on other sections)</em>
</ol>
<h2> <font color=blue> Status </font> </h2>
Section 2 has been updated to change the way on/off attributes are
encoded.  Hopefully that means sections 2, 3, and 4 are now effectively
finished.  Section 5 (DCC) still needs a lot more work.

<h2> <font color=blue> Join the Discussion </font> </h2>
Our mailing list has moved!  Lindsay's machine finally revolted against the
load we were placing on it, so the list has moved to
<u>the-project.org</u>.

<h2> <font color=blue> Demos </font> </h2>
This section will probably be very small until the draft achieves some
stability.
<p>
There is a small
<a href="ctcp2-1.1.jar">Java demo</a> app (please read the
<a href="README">README file</a> first)
which demonstrates what CTCP text attributes (section 2) will behave like.
This was updated in October 1997 to reflect recent changes in that part of
the draft (so check it out!).
